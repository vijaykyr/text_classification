java|jar,exporting and running a jar  i wish to export a rather big jar - which has many dependencies from eclipse. i should also mention that my classpath differs from my buildpath  and on export i would like the classpath files to be exported as well as exporting it with the proper  running configuration .    so may questions: 1. how can i export the classpath jars with my jar  should i replace the builfpath entries with the classpath s  2. any quick way to get this done  3. when i run the resulting jar - should i just run it  java -jar myjar.jar   or do i need to specify a  -classpath ...  as well to reference it to the other jars  (note: on eclipse i am using - the export all jars option + i choose the runtime configuration and at the end result i can see a manifest file containg information).    help would be greatly appreciated.
java|cryptography|aes|salt,aes decryption is always null  i tried using salt to decrypt a <code>aes</code> encrypted message but it always returns <code>null</code> value. can anyone look at it where am i doing wrong    <pre><code>public static string decryptmessage(string encryptedmessage  string salt) {    string decryptedmessage = null;   string valuetodecrypt = encryptedmessage;   try {     key key = generatekey();     cipher c = cipher.getinstance(algorithm);     c.init(cipher.decrypt_mode  key);       for (int i = 0; i &lt; iterations; i++) {       byte[] decodedvalue = base64.decodebase64(valuetodecrypt);       byte[] decval = c.dofinal(decodedvalue);       decryptedmessage = new string(decval).substring(salt.length());       valuetodecrypt = decryptedmessage;     }     } catch (exception e) {     e.printstacktrace();    }   return decryptedmessage; }  **edit:** </code></pre>   here is corresponding encryption method which i assume  works.   <pre><code>private static final string algorithm =  aes ;     private static final int iterations = 5;     private static final byte[] keyvalue = new byte[] {  1    2    3    4                5    6    7    8    9    0    1    2    3    4    5    6  };       public static string encryptmessage(string message  string salt) {         string encmessage = null;         byte[] encval = null;         string messagewithsalt = null;         try {             key key = generatekey();              cipher c = cipher.getinstance(algorithm);             c.init(cipher.encrypt_mode  key);              for (int i = 0; i &lt; iterations; i++) {                 messagewithsalt = salt + encmessage;                 encval = c.dofinal(messagewithsalt.getbytes());                 byte[] encryptedvalue = new base64().encode(encval);                 encmessage = new string(encryptedvalue);             }          } catch (exception e) {             e.printstacktrace();          }         return encmessage;     } </code></pre>   ps: iteration is not 0;
php|ajax|timer|scheduler,curious about ajax being asynchronous and scheduled/timer event  i want a clarification about ajax on something i was thinking about...    ajax is said to be asynchronous - if you want it to be - meaning that if a javascript is run while a page loads and in that an ajax call is executed the page will continue to load while the server process the ajax request... so is it safe to assume that it can be liken to a pseudo-parallelism     now  what about two different javascripts making an ajax call consequently. that is  while the page loads it encounters two js function one after the other each making an ajax call each. because they are different js functions/ or two different js files do they have to wait for the functions to return before they move on  i think that is the case...    and finally the real question i have... if i have a js function called and in that function i palce two ajax calls then will they be processed semi-simultaneously... because i was trying something on a webpage of mine and by accident i placed two ajax calls one after the other and i think that was the reason i had some unexpected results. unfortunately i was in a hurry to deliver so i didn t pursue it but i was wondering if it world like that  because it would be very convenient for some cases...    somethign like this   <pre><code>function finalizereservation(){     var request = $.ajax({         type:        post           url:         ./scripts/php/reserve.php           data:       {                  }          datatype:    json      });      request.done(function(data textstatus jqxhr) {      });      request.fail(function(jqxhr  textstatus  errorthrown) {     });      var request2 = $.ajax({         type:        post           url:         ./scripts/php/reserve.php           data:       {                   }          datatype:    json      });      request2.done(function(data textstatus jqxhr) {      });      request2.fail(function(jqxhr  textstatus  errorthrown) {     }); </code></pre>   }    simply curious.    i was thinking it because i have a web page that records reservations. before finalizing a reservation though the guest can see the details and think about it. at that period the slot in the database is set to pending and making unavailable to another guest so they don t clash or enter in race conditions (i.e while thinking about it the other finalizes it and so when he tries to finalize it himself he cant or if was careless in the code also finalizes it). the problem is in the guest behaviour  although i have tried to capture all events of the refresh  backpage  exit tab  close window kind so the slot doesn t stay in a pending state if the guest for some reason doesn t close the form the correct way (cancel) not all are captured in all browsers. so i though about making a time limit in the server and if it exceeds it and the state is still pending the state is reversed to free (i have the form on a minute timer  after the minute goes it automatically closes and frees the slot). the problem is that the hosting server doesn t support chron jobs although i don t know much about them so i am not sure how much help they would be and the mysql doesn t support schedulers. so i thought about making two ajax call and the one to be a timer that will check the state of the slot after some time passes and act accordingly.    any thoughts are appreciated. sorry for the long post.
c#|asp.net|asp.net-mvc|partial-views|viewbag,how to pass value from partial view to shared view _layout.cshtml in asp.net mvc   there is a controller which catches an exception. i would like to pass the error message to a generic javascript in _layout.cshtml so as to apply to all pages. it is totally find if the value is passed from normal view to _layout.cshtml by  e.g. @viewbag =  error message ; in the view or viewbag.errormessage =  error message ; in the controller  but it is not working in partial view.    what should i do in order to pass the string message from partial view to _layout.cshtml
php|jquery|arrays|sorting,sorting array by value containing the part of string  i have an array of scripts   <pre><code>array (     [0] =&gt; /js/ionslider/ion.rangeslider.min.js     [1] =&gt; /media/jquery/jquery-2.1.4.min.js     [2] =&gt; /media/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js     [3] =&gt; /widgets/wid_menu/js/menu.js ) </code></pre>   how can i sort this to get results:   <pre><code>array (     [0] =&gt; /media/jquery/jquery-2.1.4.min.js                 [1] =&gt; /media/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js     [2] =&gt; /js/ionslider/ion.rangeslider.min.js             [3] =&gt; /widgets/menu/js/menu.js ) </code></pre>   e.g put jquery script and bootstrap at the top.  p.s jquery version file may be changed in the future. thanks!
java|android|c++|jni,calling system.loadlibrary twice for the same shared library  i have the situation when two jar libraries use the same shared library. in each library  the main interface  class loads the .so file with <code>system.loadlibrary</code>. my question is: if the user decides to use these two jar libraries in one project  would the second call to <code>system.loadlibrary</code> for the same .so file cause any exception  or is it  somehowe handled  by the system to prevent shared libraries from being loaded twice  or maybe there is a  commonly known pattern  to handle such situations     the jni wrappers are targeted to be used on android. i am the author of both wrapper libs so answering you can assume full control on java sources.
c#|function,showing warning when function result is not assigned to variable  i have a function that returns modified copy of object which called this function. i often do something like this:   <pre><code>obj = obj.foo(param); </code></pre>   don t ask why  i simply have to. but sometimes i (and others) forgot to assign function result  doing this:   <pre><code>obj.foo(param); </code></pre>   which repeatedly leads to time-consuming debuging.    is there any way to show an warning or error every time when function result is not assigned to a variable  or any other suggestions how to solve this issue

c#|filehelpers,how to comment or ignore a line in the txt file using filehelpers  ignorefirst(int) or ignorelast(int) only ignore a fixed number of lines as header or footer. but i like to ignore or comment a specific line(s) in the txt/csv file. for example like below (ignore some paragraphs or a specific line in txt/csv):   <pre><code>############# this is a comment ########## /* some comment paragraph   some more comments last line of comment */ 1 foo fooitem1 2 foo fooitem2 3 goo gooitem3 #4 doo dooitem4 &lt;-- ignore.  5 eoo eooitem5 </code></pre>   i have read about beforereadrecord and skipthisrecord that could potentially resolve this problem  but the documentation is as simple as the image  and has no explanation nor supply an example.     <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/pnexu.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/pnexu.png  alt= enter image description here ></a>
javascript|squarespace|p5.js,full-screen code block/banner (squarespace)  i am in the process of developing a portfolio website. my existing website is poorly formatted and designed and i would like to move over to squarespace  however i am struggling to inject my p5.js sketches into squarespace.    in my <a href= http://lockedsgn.com/home2.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >existing website</a> i have placed a p5.js sketch behind my title. this is achieved by coding the script to span the width of the page and dynamically resize. my title text is styled in css to appear in front of the script with it s z-index. (simple right )    in my new <a href= https://aiden-locke-th3p.squarespace.com  rel= nofollow noreferrer >squarespace site</a>  i would like to create the same effect  by choosing  advanced  when editing the banner content  and the inserting the code for the script under  page header code injection   as well as embedding a link to the p5.js library. when i do this i end up with a white screen and no animation.     tl;dr moving my bootstrap site to squarespace  can t inject a p5.js script into my banner.

javascript|jquery|html|timer|onchange,auto submit form after x mili seconds of inactive keyboard  in my form i have a set of input boxes where a user can input a value. on change of one of these boxes  the form automatically gets submitted.    the problem now is however that a user stays in the last field  takes the mouse and presses the ok button (of another form) without leaving the textbox first. the change event doesn t get triggered and the old  incorrect values get passed to the next page.    i want to trigger the onchange event after a few miliseconds of inactive keyboard. just like most autocomplete plugins do.<br> i think i could implement a timer that starts timing the moment you enter an input field and gets resetted everytime a keystroke is handled and then when it reaches zero the onchange event gets triggered.    i m not up for re-inventing the wheel and was wondering if such a function is available somewhere.<br> suggestions

android|google-play,faking contacts for screenshots  are there any easy way to load fake contacts in your phone  so that you can take screenshots and videos of your app     one idea would be to create a new google account with fake contacts  but i don t think there is a way to make your application display the contacts of that account only  without any additional programming involved.
c#|wcf|entity-framework-4|ef-code-first|circular-reference,how to handle circular references -or- break references beneath first level children returned in wcf services exposing entity framework data model   i am trying to expose my data model (code first entity framework) via wcf web services over json.  the model has multiple many-to-many relationships and has lazy loading enabled.  our web services should be able to return only the first level of multiple child objects.  i continue to receive the following error:     cannot evaluate expression because the current thread is in a stack overflow state.     i realize that this error is occurs when serializing data that has a circular reference.      after reading another thread i attempted the following remedies to handle the circular reference:   <ul> <li>wcf and datacontractserializer: explicitly mark your entities with datacontract[isreference=true] and all properties with [datamember] attributes. this will allow you to use circular references. if you are using t4 template to generate entities you must modify it to add these attributes for you.</li> <li>wcf and datacontractserializer: implicit serialization. mark one of related navigation properties with [ignoredatamember] attribute so that property is not serialized.</li> <li>xmlserializer: mark one fo related navigation properties with [xmlignore] attribute</li> <li>other serializations: mark one of related navigation properties with [nonserialized] (+1 for haz he was the first to mention this) for common serialization or [scriptignore] for some json related serialization.</li> </ul>   none of these different approaches have worked.  all i really need is the first level of the children objects.  i do not need the children of the children so to speak.  i added the following code to manually break the references to the child objects of the first level children  and this worked but is not a valid solution:   <pre><code>    [webinvoke(method =  post   responseformat = webmessageformat.json  uritemplate =  getreporttypes )]     public list&lt;reporttype&gt; getreporttypes()     {         list&lt;reporttype&gt; result = businesslogic.getreporttypes(_context).tolist();         foreach (var x in result)         {             foreach (var y in x.sections)             {                 y.reporttype = null;             }          };         return result;     } </code></pre>   i am looking for a solid approach to handling the serialization of objects with many-to-many relationships in ef exposed via wcf -or- simply to just break the references below the first level children.  i am open to making changes to the data model or reconfiguring the web service somehow.    for completeness  listed below is all of my relevant code:   <pre><code>[datacontract(isreference = true)] [table( reporttype   schema =  reporting )] public class reporttype {     [key]     [column( id )]     [databasegenerated(databasegeneratedoption.identity)]     [datamember]     public int id { get;

c#|asp.net|parsing|asp.net-web-api|asp.net-web-api2,how to customise the parsing received with fromuri in web api 2   i would like to customise the way some properties are binded when the webservice tries to parse from a complex type (a class) received through a [fromuri] parameter.    the <strong>controller method</strong>:   <pre><code>[httpget] [route( test )] public ihttpactionresult complexpropertiestest([fromuri] mycomplexpropertiesclass parameters) </code></pre>   the <strong>class</strong>:   <pre><code> public class mycomplexpropertiesclass     {         public datetime testtime { get; set; }          public ienumerable&lt;int&gt; testintenumeration { get; set; }          public int simpleint { get; set; }          public string simplestring { get; set; }          // more properties...     } </code></pre>   <code>testtime</code> needs to be parsed from strings with <code>yyyymmddthhmmss</code> date format and only the time part <code>hhmmss</code> has to be stored.    <code>testenumeration</code> can be received as a string like <code>5 20 50 100 9</code> and it has to be stored as an <code>ienumerable[int]</code>.    example of url:    <pre><code>http://www.example.com/test testtime=20170303t091500&amp;testenumeration=5 20 50 100 9. </code></pre>   i’ve tried the <code>httpparameterbinding</code> approach in <a href= http://www.vickram.me/custom-datetime-model-binding-in-asp-net-web-api/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://www.vickram.me/custom-datetime-model-binding-in-asp-net-web-api/</a>  but it works only if i change the controller method to something like:   <pre><code>public ihttpactionresult complexpropertiestest ([modelbinder(typeof(commaseparatedintegercollectionmodelbinder))] ienumerable&lt;int&gt; testintenumeration  …all the other parameters…)` </code></pre>   but this is not a good solution because i would need to modify the controller to manually assign every argument to the properties of a new mycomplexpropertiesclass instance.    also  i’ve attempted the <code>commadelimitedcollectionmodelbinder</code> approach in <a href= http://www.strathweb.com/2013/04/asp-net-web-api-parameter-binding-part-1-understanding-binding-from-uri/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://www.strathweb.com/2013/04/asp-net-web-api-parameter-binding-part-1-understanding-binding-from-uri/</a>   <pre><code>internal class custommodelbinder : imodelbinder {     public bool bindmodel(httpactioncontext actioncontext  modelbindingcontext bindingcontext)     {         valueproviderresult val = bindingcontext.valueprovider.getvalue(bindingcontext.modelname);         if (val .attemptedvalue == null)         {             return false;         }    } } </code></pre>   i receive <code>parameters</code> in bindingcontext.modelname  but logically there is no <code>valueprovider</code> for <code>mycomplexpropertiesclass</code>. i could try to get the values of  <code>actioncontext.request.requesturi.query</code>  but then i would need to manually parse every property and assign the values to a new instance of <code>mycomplexpropertiesclass</code> using reflection. i would be nice to parse manually the ones i want  leveraging the default web api 2 binding process for the rest.    could you help me  please

php|session|referrals,getting data from previous page  i have a trivial question.    i need to get data from previous page. for example  i am in some kind of category view  and then i could click on button to add new post. i want to get category information to autofill for post.    but  till now  i have only two ideas  how to do that. one - setting session with data in current category view to use it in post page  or getting information from previous category view address information with agent referral.    any other ideas     ps sorry  i didn t mentioned anything about this project at all... this is php  and previous and any next pages are in the same project ;)
javascript|angularjs|string|parsing|numbers,angular data parsing string for multiple numbers  i have an array of objects coming back in my data and i need to loop through each of them and parse out specific numbers.    here s what one of the objects looks like.     object      {     reportid: 13       reportname:  testing        acceptableflag:  n/a        whereclause:  where filter_5_id =  50001  and filter_12_id = 120087  order by tr.test_result_id null      }    basically i need to get this whereclause field and parse through it and extract these 5 digit ids  for some reason some of them will have a single quote on it  and the other will be as you see the 120087. also if there is a second one  it could also be wrapped in parantheses  (120087) like this. any advice
c#|.net|events,event priority and process order  is there a way to specify an order or priority to handle registered event delegates   for example  i have an event that i would like processed immediately before any other events  but i want other objects to be allowed to register listeners to the event as well.  how can this be accomplished     lets say i want proc1 to always run before proc 2.   <pre><code>class messageprocessor {     private dataclient client;     public messageprocesser(dataclient dc)     {          client = dc;          client.messagereceived += processmessage;     }      void proc1(messageeventargs e)     {         // process message     }  }  class dataclient {     public event messagereceievedhandler messagereceived; }  void main() {     dataclient dc = new dataclient();     messageprocessor syncprocessor = new messageprocessor(dc); // this one is high priority and needs to process all sync immediately when they arrive before any data messages     messageprocessor dataprocessor= new messageprocessor(dc);  // this one can process the data as it has time when sync messages are not being processed.      // do other stuff  } </code></pre>   the reason for doing this  i have a server that is sending messages over a udp stream.  it will send sync messages before a burst of data.  i realize both handlers will fire when a sync message is received  but to decrease latency i would like the syncprocessor objects events processed before the dataprocessor events.  this would decrease the latency of the sync message being processed.    in addition  someone else on my team may want to register events to process specific messages also.  they may have their own object that will register an event (may not be messageprocessor)  even still the sync message should have as low latency as possible.    <strong>edit  made the objective more clear with a better example.</strong>

c#|sql-server|asp.net-mvc|entity-framework|stored-procedures,sql server recognise sp_executesql as object rather than procedure name  i am using <code>dbcontext.database.sqlquery&lt;entity&gt;</code> to execute stored procedure from my c# code repository.    it works fine but i want to know that why it is executing procedure like below:   <pre><code>exec sp_executesql n exec getcaselist @casestage  n @casestage int  @casestage=9 </code></pre>   rather than    <pre><code>exec getcaselist @casestage = 9 </code></pre>   and is there any way that my all procedures execute from c# like this<br> <code>exec getcaselist @casestage = 9</code> rather than <code>exec sp_executesql n exec getcaselist @casestage  n @casestage int  @casestage=9</code>     how can i make sql server profiler to treat procedure name as object rather than sp_executesql       note: i want to execute procedure from c# as <code>exec getcaselist @casestage = 9</code> because i am saving trace data through <strong>sql server profiler</strong> in table format. and in <strong>objectname</strong> column  it is showing sp_executesql as object rather than procedure name(getcaselist) as object. <strong>i can make changes only from c# code.</strong>

javascript|html5,delay the firing of the  onload  event  i have an api that a number of my clients use  using my own specifications and instructions for manipulating it from their own sites. it means that  unfortunately for me  changing the html code on their side is not an option. this is the general idea how their code looks and i need to make it still work after i do the changes i want:   <pre><code>&lt;script src= player.js &gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt;     console.log(player.someproperty); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   i want to do the following changes:   <ul> <li>rename player.js to player_2.0.js</li> <li>create a small script which will be named player.js so the html5 at the top would work like it did before. then player.js would load player_2.0.js dynamically.</li> </ul>   the problem is when the following part of the code gets to be exectuded   <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;     console.log(player.someproperty); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   player_2.0.js still isn t done loading  resulting player.someproperty to be undefined.    so my question is if i can manipulate or postpone the  onload  event for player.js script until it s done loading player_2.0.js  or do anything that could get me accomplish that.
python|oracle|import|document|cx-oracle,importing data to oracle using python cx_oracle  hi i am new to python (programming and stackoverflow).  first let me start by saying a little bit about what i am doing and trying to do.      i am using an internal xml api to pull data from an internal database     i parse/format xml result into a txt document (automated this to occur at a    set interval)    i want to write or import the contents of this document to an oracle database    how would i go about importing or writing this document into an existing oracle database   i can t seem to find much in the way of documentation with regards to the cx_oracle module that i am using to establish a connection with my database.  could any of you kind folk point me in a direction / resource to accomplish this

python|sql-server|ibm|spss,automating ibm spss data collection survey export   i m so sorry for the vague question here  but i m hoping an spss expert will be able to help me out here. we have some surveys that are done via spss  from which we extract data for an internal report. right now the process is very cumbersome and requires going to the spss data collection interviewer server administration page and manually exporting data from two different projects (which takes hours at a time!). we then take that data  massage it  and upload it to another database that drives the internal report.    my question is  does anyone out there know how to automate this process  is there a sql server database behind the spss data  where does the .mdd file come in to play  can my team (who is well-versed in extracting data from various sources) tap into the sql server database behind spss to get our data  or do we need some sort of python script and plugin     if i m missing information that would be helpful in answering the question  please let me know. i m happy to provide it; i just don t know what to provide.    thanks so much.

c#|asp.net-mvc,not getting all results from partition  i am having an issue with my program creating partitions but not querying for each partition. the reason why i have to use partitions is because i am creating an odata query string to my services api and if i query for more than 55 policies at one time the query string becomes too long and fails. i can see where my application divides the policies into separate partitions but thats as far as it goes. it queries for one and then does nothing for the other. thanks for your help.     ** edit once it partitions it gets here    <pre><code>  public void getalleligibleunredeemedpoliciesforeachactiveagentcodefortheagent()     {         agentpoliciesforeachagentcode = new list&lt;dtoapp2leadpolicy&gt;();         foreach (var agentcode in _app2agent.alloftheagentcodesfortheagent)         {             if (agentpolicies != null)                 agentpolicies = new list&lt;dtoapp2leadpolicy&gt;();             settheagentcode(agentcode);             setagentpolicynumbersbyagentcode();             setallpolicynumbersbyagentseligiblepolicies();             setagentpoliciesfromatlamservices();             if (agentpolicies != null) agentpoliciesforeachagentcode.addrange(agentpolicies);         }     } </code></pre>   and the first partition gets skipped and not addedd.    <pre><code>public void partitionthepolicynumbers()     {         partitionsofpolicynumbers = allpolicynumbers.partition&lt;string&gt;( numberofpolicynumberpartitions);     }      public void querythewebservicesforeligiblepolicydtosusingeachpartition()     {         foreach         (var partition in partitionsofpolicynumbers)         {             setthepolicynumbersforthepartition(partition);             setagentpolicydtosfromwebservices();             setpoliciesforagentview();             addeligiblepolicydtosfromwebservicescalltoalleligiblepoliciesforagent();         }     }      public void setthepolicynumbersforthepartition(ienumerable&lt;string&gt; policynumbers)     {         this.policynumbers = policynumbers;     }      public void addeligiblepolicydtosfromwebservicescalltoalleligiblepoliciesforagent()     {         if (alleligiblepoliciesforagentview == null) alleligiblepoliciesforagentview = new list&lt;dtoapp2leadpolicy&gt;();         foreach (var policydto in _app2lead.agentpolicies)         {             alleligiblepoliciesforagentview.add(policydto);         }     }      public void setnumberofpartitionsforpolicynumbers()     {         numberofpolicynumberpartitions = calculatenumberofpolicynumberpartitions();     }      public int calculatenumberofpolicynumberpartitions()     {         var numberofpolicynumbers = allpolicynumbers.count();         if (numberofpolicynumbers &lt; 55) return 1;         return (numberofpolicynumbers / 55) + 1;      } </code></pre>
java|visualvm|jdk-tools,visualvm cannot see a java process launched from cygwin  if i start a java process in a cygwin console  and then launch visualvm  the later cannot see the former.    if i start the same process in a dos console visualvm sees it fine. i am in jdk1.6.0_25. this happens both in win7 32b  and in win7 64b with a 64b jvm.    anyone can think of an explanation/workaround
python|python-3.x,how should i store this data   i am making a golf scoring program using python 3 which  for each of the 18 holes stores: the hole number  the par  the difficulty rank  and the target score.    the target score is calculated from the par  difficulty  and handicap (which may be changed by the user).    what would you advise to be the best method for storing this data so that it can be displayed in a table-like fashion  and the target score easily changed if the user edits the value of the handicap     i don t really know where to start as i have very little experience.    thanks.
android,how do i create a speed dial button programmatically   so i ve created a simple launcher using <a href= http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-custom-launcher-on-android--cms-21358  rel= nofollow >this tutorial</a>. i ve created a few empty buttons that i intend to use to dial a number instantly when they are pressed.    by default  the buttons have no assigned number. i want the button to launch the default contacts application window when first pressed  so the user can select a contact s number to assign to the button. i ll then launch this through an intent.     i have no idea how to make the first part of this work (bringing up the contacts app  and then assigning details to the button). how do i make this work
c#|silverlight|windows-phone-7|timestamp|windows-phone,good way to store and read timestamp in windows phone  i am working on a windows phone app.    just want to ask for some suggestion. here is the problem: <br> i want to store a time in somewhere and use the time to check if i need an internal file update. (if my file has not been updated in 60 days  update it. something like this)    i am not sure if i can have access to the registry directly in the app. and the other possible way to solve the problem is maybe save the timestamp to a file in isolated storage. but i dont have a lot idea about how to save it in a easy to use format and how  to read it again.    any suggestions about saving timestamp     thank you
jquery|css|jquery-ui|jquery-ui-tabs,jquery ui tabs displayed as a vertical grid - last selected tab breaks design  using jquery 1.7.1 and jquery ui 1.8.21.    i am struggling with a bug in my <strong>custom jquery ui tabs</strong>. my tabs are not the usual horizontal type  i have them displayed vertically (fixed width) as some kind of grid and my content is on the right (see picture below).    now my issue is that <strong>everything goes down whenever i select the last tab of the line</strong> (5 10 15 ...)  and 6 comes under 5. the right picture illustrates the problem :    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/da3j8.jpg  alt= enter image description here > <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/at1qr.jpg  alt= enter image description here >    the reasons behind the use of tabs is that i can use approximately 30k lines from a previous project.    here is my <strong>vertical tabs</strong> :   <pre><code>$( #chapters )     .tabs({ ... })     .addclass( ui-tabs-vertical ui-helper-clearfix ); </code></pre>   my <strong>css</strong>  it includes a lot of tests and mistakes and useless parts but still :   <pre><code>.ui-tabs-vertical .ui-tabs-nav {     padding: 2px;     float: left;     width: 185px;     display:inline; } .ui-tabs-vertical .ui-tabs-nav li {     width:30px;     height:30px;     margin: 2px;     padding:0;     display:inline; } .ui-tabs-vertical .ui-tabs-nav li a {     display:block;     margin:0;padding:0;width:100%;height:100%; } .ui-tabs-vertical .ui-tabs-nav li a span {     display:block;     padding:0;     margin:0;     width:100%;     height:100%;     text-align: center;     line-height: 30px;     vertical-align: middle; } .ui-tabs-vertical .ui-tabs-panel {     padding: 3px;     padding-left:200px;     max-width: 548px; /* = 768px -10-paddings */ } .ui-tabs-vertical .ui-state-active {     border: 0 solid #000000; } .ui-tabs-vertical .ui-tabs-selected {     padding-bottom: 0 !important;     border: 0 solid #000000; } </code></pre>   the <strong>html</strong> as requested in comments  it is completely <strong>generated through js</strong> as there is a lot of algorithms handling these tabs more or less randomly  so here is the structure :   <pre><code>&lt;div id= chapters  style= position:relative  class= ui-tabs &gt;     &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;!-- li tags coming from a for-loop --&gt;         &lt;li&gt;             &lt;a href= #800001 &gt; &lt;!-- random id but matching divs order --&gt;                 &lt;span style= float:left &gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- 1 2 3... --&gt;             &lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;         &lt;!-- ... --&gt;         &lt;div id= 800001  class= ui-tabs-hide &gt;             &lt;div id= 800001_content &gt;                 &lt;!-- content is loaded here later...

python|multithreading,multiple functions (or instances of the same function ) in python   i m trying to make an animatronic shooting gallery using 2 arduinos  and maybe a servo controller. arduino 1 handles all the guns and targets and sends single byte commands to the computer (over com3) for each target hit (max 30 targets).    the python program needs to receive this information  and play audio and read a file containing motor position and time information  and send out the single-byte motor position codes to arduino 2 on com4 (max 256 motors)  and possibly a servo controller on com 5  but only if i get things working with simple on/off motors/solenoids  and bi-directional motors.     each target hit may activate a routine lasting several seconds. i have no problem getting python to play one file  and send out motor position data to several motors that are working together  but i can t figure out a way to get multiple characters (each character is a group of motors working synchronously with each other) running through separate routines simultaneously.    the plan was to create a single bot() class  and make each character an instance of that class  then call a function within them that would run the routine when their respective targets are hit.     i ve looked at multithreading  but i m not sure if it s what i m looking for. i am fairly new to python and programming in general  and i don t want to go down the wrong path if there is a simpler solution.

javascript|ios|iphone|twitter|cross-browser,why is javascript not executing on a web page when accessed via ios twitter browser   i am completely stumped and i m sure this was working before.     i have a simple web page with the word  hello  in a div which does two things onload:    1) alert  2     2) change the text of the div to  bye     all vanilla javascript  no libraries.    this works fine on the chrome  ie  ff  safari (as you d expect). if i hit a link in the ios twitter app (latest version) to this web page neither of those two things happen. it seems to me that the javascript is not being executed at all but how can this be  has anyone else experienced this     update    in fact vanilla javascript will work. the alert test was misleading - i believe thats been disabled which is why it won t work. jquery will not work however - possibly to do with the $ reference conflicting.    update 2    the problem has moved on now - my initial assumptions were not entirely correct.    the following code for a web page works:   <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;  &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;     &lt;meta name= viewport  content= width=device-width  /&gt;     &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;      &lt;script src= https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js &gt;&lt;/script&gt;      &lt;style&gt;         #test {             color:red;         }     &lt;/style&gt;      &lt;script&gt;          window.onload = function () {             document.getelementbyid( test ).innerhtml =  vanilla javascript worked ;             $( #test ).text( jquery worked );         }      &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt;      &lt;div id= test &gt;         hello     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>   the following code does not work. the path to my script is sound and works on normal browsers  but when in the ios twitter in-app browser it seems the local script will not load:   <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;  &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;     &lt;meta name= viewport  content= width=device-width  /&gt;     &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;      &lt;script src= ~/scripts/jquery-2.1.1.js  type= text/javascript &gt;&lt;/script&gt;      &lt;style&gt;         #test {             color:red;         }     &lt;/style&gt;      &lt;script&gt;          window.onload = function () {             document.getelementbyid( test ).innerhtml =  vanilla javascript worked ;             $( #test ).text( jquery worked );         }      &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt;      &lt;div id= test &gt;         hello     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>   i have tested the issue on accessing the webpage via facebook which also works fine either way. the problem is with the twitter browser only on ios.    i have tried using an absolute path to my script which also does not work.    update    this issue is not on ipad. it is iphone only. as it was working before fine i d say this is a bug from the latest release of the iphone twitter app. will wait for a fix from twitter.

c#|asp.net-mvc|linq|entity-framework,search based on a set of keywords  i need to make a search based on a set of keywords  that return all the ads related with those keywords. then the result is a list of categories with the ads count for each category.     the search is made in a keywordsearch table:   <pre><code>public class keywordsearch {     public int id { get; set; }     public string name { get; set; }     public keyword keyword { get; set; } } </code></pre>   where the keyword table is:   <pre><code>public class keyword {     public int id { get; set; }     public string name { get; set; } } </code></pre>   the ads are related with the keywords using the following table:   <pre><code>public class keywordadcategory {     [key]     [column( keyword_id   order = 0)]     public int keyword_id { get; set; }      [key]     [column( ad_id   order = 1)]     public int ad_id { get; set; }      [key]     [column( category_id   order = 2)]     public int category_id { get; set; } } </code></pre>   finally  the category table:   <pre><code>public class category {     public int id { get; set; }     public string name { get; set; } } </code></pre>   example:   <ul> <li>keywords:  mercedes-benz  and  glk </li> <li>keywordsearch:  mercedes  and  benz  for the keyword  mercedes-benz                 glk  for the keyword  glk  </li> <li>category:  cars  and  trucks </li> <li> ads: car - mercedes-benz glk     truck - mercedes-benz citan    if i search  mercedes-benz  i get:   <ul> <li>cars: 1</li> <li>trucks: 1</li> </ul>   if i search  mercedes-benz glk  i get:   <ul> <li>cars: 1</li> </ul>   if i search  mercedes citan  i get:   <ul> <li>trucks: 1</li> </ul></li> </ul>   what i get until now:   <pre><code>var keywordids = from k in keywordsearchquery                     where splitkeywords.contains(k.name)                     select k.keyword.id;  var matchingkac = from kac in keywordadcategoryquery                     where keywordids.distinct().contains(kac.keyword_id)                     select kac;  var addids = from kac in matchingkac              group kac by kac.ad_id into d              where d.count() == splitkeywords.count()              select d.key;  var groupedkac = from kac in keywordadcategoryquery                     where addids.contains(kac.ad_id)               &lt;--- edit2                     group kac by new { kac.category_id  kac.ad_id };  var result = from grp in groupedkac                 group grp by grp.key.category_id into final                 join c in categoryquery on final.key equals c.id                 select new categorygetallbysearchdto                 {                     id = final.key                      name = c.name                      listcontroller = c.listcontroller                      listaction = c.listaction                      searchcount = final.count()                 }; </code></pre>   the problem is that i can t get only the ads that match all keywords.    edit:     when a keyword is made of 2 or more keywordsearches like  mercedes-benz   the line  where d.count() == splitkeywords.count()  fails  because d.count = 1 and splitkeywords.count = 2 for  mercedes-benz     any help

javascript|jquery|html|asp.net|animation,how to make a correct delay before function executing   so  i m trying to do a loading animation for my website on asp.net webforms. i have noticed that some pages are loading really fast and some are not.  i have made an execution of an animation in this way:   <pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {           $( #loadingimage ).hide();          $( #loading ).html(  );      }); </code></pre>   but now i want to make a delay  approximately in 1-2 sec for pages that load fast to not show the animation for them. i try to do this in this way:   <pre><code>settimeout(checkdocument  3000);    function hideloading() {       $( #loadingimage ).hide();       $( #loading ).html(  );   }    function checkdocument() {       $(document).ready(hideloading);   }; </code></pre>   my html code:   <pre><code> &lt;div id= loading  style= text-align: center  &gt;&lt;asp:image id= loadingimage  runat= server   imageurl= ~/images/loading.gif  /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   so  this works wrong. this code executed my animation at once and then off the animation in 3 seconds. help to find out the right way for this. and one more  i have this line of code   <pre><code>$( #loading ).html(  ); </code></pre>   why if we not use nothing as argument in html part  then animation can t stop  when we take    to the html then everything works. please  explain this moment.

android|windows|sdk,android sdk manager showing no system images  i have been fighting this all day with no success.  i have removed &amp; re-installed the sdk multiple times  i ve tried http:// and https://  i ve cleared cache..  i m at a loss.    i m on w10 x64.  my android sdk manager shows no system images available for download at all.  it shows everything else - all the platforms  documentation  etc. - but no images of any kind.      i have tried all the possible combinations of  new/updates    installed   and  obsolete  to no avail.  i have run the sdk manager as administrator  and i am not getting any errors in the log (ie  some users reported  connection refused  errors).  by all accounts  everything works - but i have no images available.    does anyone have any thoughts on this     thanks in advance!!

php|mysql|ios|database|cocoa-touch,problems with php and mysql  i am working within xcode and have an ios application that you input information and the app connects to a db via a php file. there is no problem when uploading  a name or an email address. but for some reason when it comes to uploading a good amount of text  via a <code>uitextview</code>  there becomes a problem. it succeeds when there are no punctuation at all. but when there is a period  or a question mark  it does not get uploaded to the server  it just fails. but with the email field  there is no problem when it comes to periods or even that <code>@</code> symbol. i am not fluent in php or mysql backend stuff  so i am very confused. here is the code for the php file:   <pre><code>if (isset ($_get[ firstname ]) &amp;&amp; isset($_get[ lastname ]) &amp;&amp; isset($_get[ emailaddress ]) &amp;&amp; isset($_get[ devicetype ]) &amp;&amp; isset($_get[ problemtextfield ]) &amp;&amp; isset($_get[ iosversion ])){     $firstname = $_get[ firstname ];     $lastname = $_get[ lastname ];     $emailaddress = $_get[ emailaddress ];     $devicetype = $_get[ devicetype ];     $problemtextfield = $_get[ problemtextfield ];     $iosversion = $_get[ iosversion ];  } else {     $firstname =  user first name ;     $lastname =  user last name ;     $emailaddress =  user email address ;     $devicetype =  user device type ;     $problemtextfield =  user problem text field ;     $iosversion =  user ios version ; }  $con = mysql_connect($db_hostname $db_user $db_pass) or die(mysql_error());  mysql_select_db($db_name $con) or die(mysql_error());   $sql =  insert into $db_table (firstname  lastname  emailaddress  devicetype  problemtextfield  iosversion  status  second_status) values( $firstname   $lastname        $emailaddress   $devicetype   $problemtextfield   $iosversion    unanswered    answered ) ;   $res = mysql_query($sql $con) or die(mysql_error());  mysql_close($con); if ($res) {   echo  success ; }else{   echo  failed ; } </code></pre>   like i said  i am not fluent in php  so please be nice when pulling apart my syntax for the php file.    edit: after a whole day of debugging  i have realized that if i take away spaces from in between words  everything is fine. is there a reason for this  i don t want to have to put plus s in between everything  i know that is not correct.     here is my xcode code:    <pre><code>nsstring *strurl = [nsstring stringwithformat:@ http://www.website.com/phpfile.php firstname=%@&amp;lastname=%@&amp;emailaddress=%@&amp;devicetype=%@&amp;problemtextfield=%@&amp;iosversion=%@   firstname.text  lastname.text  emailaddress.text  devicetype.text  self.problemtextbox.text  iosversion.text];      // to execute php code     nsdata *dataurl = [nsdata datawithcontentsofurl:[nsurl urlwithstring:strurl]];      // to receive the returend value     nsstring *strresult = [[nsstring alloc] initwithdata:dataurl encoding:nsutf8stringencoding];` </code></pre>

java|android|handler,handler.postdelayed not called when mobilephone in standby mode  i m trying to write a simple app that should mute my mobile phone for a given time. it s my first android app  but after many hours of reading i think it is nearly completed. but it still has one problem that i can not fix.    i m using a activity to display the gui. it has buttons to set the start and end time  and everything else needed. when the user has entered all the parameters  they are passed to a service. this service uses a handler object  to register 2 callbacks (with handler.postdelayed). one for start mute and one for end mute (in setmuteintervall). the first tests seemed to work  but if i try to mute it for like 30 minutes  it never unmutes. i think it has something to do with the fact  that the mobilephone is or was in standby mode. i also tried to use handler.postat() but that didn t work either (and time relative to uptime was somewhat confusing).    so  what should i do to guarantee  that my callbacks are called  regardless whether the phone is in standby or not     here s the source of my program:    <a href= http://pastebin.com/xagceaq9  rel= nofollow >http://pastebin.com/xagceaq9</a>    <a href= http://pastebin.com/33nepfv5  rel= nofollow >http://pastebin.com/33nepfv5</a>

javascript|css|html5|css3,.find( .class:first ) behavior with opera and safari  i m using soundmanager2 to play some audio files in a web site  but not using flash.    it works fine with firefox and chrome  as they support <code>ogg</code> and <code>mp3</code> respectively. however  it doesn t work with opera 12.16. theoretically  it supports <code>ogg</code>  and pass the condition <code>if( supports_ogg_audio() )</code>:    it is returning 1 in this function:   <pre><code>    function supports_ogg_audio() {          var a = document.createelement( audio );         return !!(a.canplaytype &amp;&amp; a.canplaytype( audio/ogg; codecs= vorbis  ).replace(/no/    ));     } </code></pre>   so it detects <code>ogg</code> support. but as i m doing:   <pre><code>currentrow = thisplayer.find( .total-row:first ); </code></pre>   i get this error from the opera console:   <pre><code>unknown pseudo class [id= total-playlist ] .total-row:first </code></pre>   so i m guessing that this is the problem. how could select the first <code>thisplayer.find( .total-row )</code> element with better browser compatibility  it neither works in safari5+ and ie9+

c#|windows|winforms|label,label not showing in winform application  i was developing a winform application for a class and i ran into a bug that i can t seem to find the root of. when i run the application everything works except for an error label that was supposed to come up with incorrect user input. at first i thought i had written the event handler for it wrong  so i stopped hiding it at startup but the label is still missing. i m not sure if i m missing something in some back-end file or if i m just missing something really obvious.    this is the function that creates the label.   <pre><code>private void initializeerrorlabel() {     int width = 200  height = 13          anchory = this.label.location.y - this.label.size.height - 3;      // initialize component     this.errorlabel.autosize = true;     this.errorlabel.font = new system.drawing.font( microsoft sans serif   8.25f  system.drawing.fontstyle.bold          system.drawing.graphicsunit.point  ((byte)(0)));     this.errorlabel.forecolor = system.drawing.color.red;     this.errorlabel.location = new system.drawing.point((xsize - width) / 2  (anchory - height));     this.errorlabel.anchor = system.windows.forms.anchorstyles.top;     this.errorlabel.name =  errorlabel ;     this.errorlabel.size = new system.drawing.size(width  height);     this.errorlabel.text =  invalid user id. please try again! ;     return; } </code></pre>   and this is the function that initializes my controls:   <pre><code>private void initializecomponent() {     this.userinput = new system.windows.forms.textbox();     this.switchmajor = new system.windows.forms.radiobutton();     this.switchtocs = new system.windows.forms.checkbox();     this.switchtoce = new system.windows.forms.checkbox();     this.keepmajor = new system.windows.forms.radiobutton();     this.acceptvalues = new system.windows.forms.button();     this.label = new system.windows.forms.label();     this.errorlabel = new system.windows.forms.label();     this.suspendlayout();      // initialize components     this.initializelabel();     this.initializemainwindow();     this.initializeuserinput();     this.initializeswitchmajorbtn();     this.initializechangetocsbtn();     this.initializechangetocebtn();     this.initializeacceptvaluesbtn();     this.initializeerrorlabel();      this.resumelayout();     this.performlayout();     return; } </code></pre>   again  not really sure what i m doing wrong here. any help would be appreciated.    thanks
c#|.net|visual-studio|visual-studio-2015,how to configure visual studio to not indent closing parenthesis on multiline function calls   i m using visual studio 2017 rc (but this probably applies to 2015 and earlier versions as well). i m working on a c# project where i have lots of code that looks like this:   <pre><code>ast = new ast(     callexpression( add )     .addchildren(         numberliteral( 4 )          numberliteral( 9 )     ) ) </code></pre>   as you can see  the code takes a nested structure where closing parenthesis match the indentation of the original function call.    my problem is that when my cursor is in between the parentheses of a new function call:   <pre><code>ast = new ast([|]) </code></pre>   and i hit enter:   <pre><code>ast = new ast(     [|]) </code></pre>   there are an extra 4 spaces left behind the closing parens  not matching the original indentation. what i want is this:   <pre><code>ast = new ast( [|]) </code></pre>   is there any way to configure vs to not add those extra spaces when hitting enter in such a context  thanks.

ajax|xmlhttprequest|innerhtml|javascript,executing javascript functions from an ajax - html response  i have a web page that displays comments  and users can click a  flag  link to report an inappropriate comment.    when they click the flag link  i use ajax and innerhtml to display a dropdown box underneath the comment with a reason code  e.g. spam  offensive  unrelated to topic  etc.  as well as a cancel button.    if the user clicks submit  i want to use another ajax request to send their response to a php file  where the database is updated  and they receive a  thank you  on their end (without reloading the page).  i essentially want the div that displays the dropdown box to be replaced with  thank you  using another ajax request.    that s where the problem is.  it seems that i cannot execute an ajax request from within the html response from the first ajax request.  the javascript functions fail -- even a simple alert( hello world ) doesn t work.  i tried placing the javascript functions in the main page that calls the first ajax request  as well placing it in the php file that displays as the html response from the first ajax request  but i did not have any luck -- the functions just do not run when they are called.    everything works fine if i load the php file externally  so i know the javascript is correct.  it just doesn t work when i load the php file into the html response div and then call the javascript from there.    so to sum everything up  how do you execute javascript functions from the html response of an ajax request     edit: here is a sample of what i want to do:    this is the ajax part that populates the div when the person clicks the flag link:   <pre><code>xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function(){ if (xmlhttp.readystate==4) {      document.getelementbyid(whichdiv).innerhtml=xmlhttp.responsetext; } }; </code></pre>   the value of xmlhttp.responsetext comes from this external file:   <pre><code>&lt;input type= hidden /&gt; &lt;script type= text/javascript  language= javascript &gt; function displayalert() {     alert ( hello world! ); } &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;form name= myform  id= myform &gt; &lt;input type= text  name= myfield  value= teststring /&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;input type= button  name= button  value= submit      onclick= displayalert(); /&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>   note: the <code>&lt;input type= hidden /&gt;</code> above comes from a suggestion i found off of <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533897%28vs.85%29.aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533897%28vs.85%29.aspx</a>.    when the user clicks the button  the javascript displayalert() function doesn t run.  the alert box never pops up.  if i load the file externally instead of calling it with innerhtml  the script works fine.    can the xmlhttp.responsetext contain javascript code
php|mysql|database,php: linking two tables to show data correctly using mysql  i have two tables connected in a different way than i want them  and i will try my best to explain what i am searching for  together with what i have accomplished myself so far.    what i am searching for: first of all  i have a table <code>objects_price</code> and a table <code>materials</code>. these tables are shown beneath:    <code>objects_price</code>:    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdyij.png  alt= table objects_price >    <code>materials</code>:    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/sxepo.png  alt= table materials >    okay so i have some objects which can be a chair  table or whatever furniture you can imaging. all objects are connected to a third table with information about the object. each object requires some sort of material in order to be crafted. as you can see in the <code>objects_price</code> table  the object with an <code>id</code> of 1 requires 47 of the material equal to 1. which is <code>oak log</code> as you can see in the <code>materials</code> table.     the object with an id of 2 requires two materials  material 2 and 3. and it requires 20 of <code>stone</code> and 30 of <code>birch log</code>     to make everything a little more clear  heres an image displaying what i just explained:    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/lco31.png  alt= displaying what i just said above >    what i have so far is two queries where one of them doesn t do what i want it to  especially because i am using an array to display the materials and the amount but what my code does is that it displays all of the materials in all of the objects  it looks like this right now:    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/fp380.png  alt= what it is like now >    the problem lies in this query and the way it creates an array:   <pre><code>$query =  select objects_price.object_id  materials.material_id  materials.name  material_amount from objects_price left join materials using(material_id) ; $result = $mysqli-&gt;query($query);  $arr = array(); while($row = $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()) {         $arr[$row[ name ]][] = $row[ material_amount ]; } </code></pre>   together with the way i provide the objects with their corresponding materials:    <pre><code>foreach($arr as $name =&gt; $objects) {  &gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt; php echo $name;  &gt;&lt;i style= float:right; &gt;&lt; php foreach($objects as $material_amount) { echo $material_amount; }  &gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt; php } </code></pre>   i hope i made it clear and please tell me if you want me to provide more code  more images or explanation or anything like that. any help  advice or suggestions are highly appreciated. thanks for your time.
python|security|browser|web-crawler,how to check if a page is displaying a specific <img> tag  what is the best way to determine if a page on a website is really displaying a specific img tag like this <code>&lt;img src=http://domain.com/img.jpg&gt;</code>    a simple string comparison is easy to fool using http comments <code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code>.  even if the html tag exists it could be deleted with javascript.  it could also be obscured by placing an image over it using css.    do you know of a solid method of detecting the img tag dispute these obscuring attacks listed    do you know of another method of obscuring the image    python code to detect the image would be ideal   but if you know of a good tactic or method that will earn you a +1 from me.

php|mysql|apache|curl|cron,php crons using file_get_contents in loop not working  ok! so here is what i m trying to accomplish... lets call the file test1.php using file_get_contents i m fetching data from one site and inserting it into another database in a loop of 3 sec because it takes 1 sec to fetch and store so with another 1 sec buffer i m hoping to get data that s no older than 5 secs.  the file works on my localhost/test1.php just fine.. on my local i add a java script to refresh the browser... if i replace my $con settings to my server  and hit the file on my local browser using wamp that works too.. the problem begins when i upload it on my server and add it as a cron  hitting it just once in the morning and letting it run all day the loop works while the values it returns are null.     things you may want to know...     1) my apache server mods enabled are the same as those on my wamp (curl installted  php 5.5.9 allow_url_fopen = on allow_url_include = off)    2)  <a href= http://i.stack.imgur.com/36kcw.jpg  rel= nofollow >apache mods</a>    3) code   <pre><code>&lt; php  $con=mysqli_connect( localhost   user   pwd   dbname ); // check connection if (mysqli_connect_errno())   {   echo  failed to connect to mysql:   . mysqli_connect_error();  }  $open_time=strtotime( 07:00:00 ); $close_time=strtotime( 23:55:00 ); $current_time=strtotime(date( h:i:s ));  /***************** end timing ********************/   if($current_time &gt;= $open_time &amp;&amp; $current_time&lt;=$close_time) {  while ($current_time &lt; $close_time) { // perform queries  $dataquery = mysqli_query(); //my query goes here while($row = $dataquery-&gt;fetch_assoc()) {     $data = @file_get_contents();              $insert = mysqli_query(); //insert this data into my db    }   sleep(3);     }   mysqli_close($con);  }   &gt; </code></pre>   4) the different ways i ve tried to execute the cron :p     php /home/domain/public_html/test1.php php5 /home/domain/public_html/test1.php php /home/domain/public_html/test/test1.php /usr/bin/php -q /home/domain/public_html/test1.php /usr/bin/php -q /home/domain/fcgid/test1.php    5) the link to file get redirects to https (i m still trying to see if its affecting anything... but i m more inclined to rule this point out as the link works and stops randomly.)    6) after fixing all errors the file returns no output  which could also mean there are no errors (or they re emailed to me)    7) when it does work for a while  it will fetch values for a while  but stops after 2-3hrs  i can see its created several connections that are idle/sleep. it freezes mysql  and sometimes maxes out the server resources. even rebooting doesn t help  values inserted after reboot are nulls and 0 s     8) i m still playing with max_execution_time .. i ve currently set to 61 200 secs (17hrs) i m also simultaneously running the same test on another sever with max_execution_time set to 60 and the cron hitting the file every 60 secs     9) like i said before  if i hit the file locally on my windows system it works like its supposed (after switching $con details to my server)i add a javascript and open it in firefox/chrome localhost/test1.php     help me please!    ************my questions************** 1) what am i doing wrong  and how would you recommend i go about doing this task.  2) what all do i need enabled/disabled on my apache/php/ 3) is there a better way of doing the same thing     <hr>

javascript|jquery|google-analytics,document.ready with/without function  and adding an array to existing code  i think this is a really newbie question so thank you for helping me learn. i m trying to implement a client side google analytics experiment am following the steps <a href= https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/experiments-client-side  rel= nofollow >here</a>.      i have always used document.ready like this   <pre><code>$( document ).ready(function() {   // handler for .ready() called. }); </code></pre>   and the instructions here recommend this (without <em>function</em>):   <pre><code>$(document).ready(   // execute the chosen view   pagevariations[chosenvariation] ); </code></pre>   i have a few other functions i want to call on the same page outside of the experiment but when i try to combine them into one document.ready  the google analytics experiment will not run.  so i have two questions:   <ol> <li> when is it ok not to include <em>function</em> with document.ready  looking at the documentation <a href= https://api.jquery.com/ready/  rel= nofollow >here</a>  i don t ever see it written without function so not i m not clear on this </li> <li> what is the correct way to add <code>pagevariations[chosenvariation]</code> to my existing document.ready   i have tried adding it to my code as shown below but the experiment only works if it is inside its own  separate document.ready.    <pre><code>        &lt;script&gt;             var chosenvariation = cxapi.choosevariation();             var pagevariations = [               function() {                 console.log( variation one );               }                 function() {                  document.getelementbyid( hero ).src =  herob.jpg ;                 document.getelementbyid( oval ).src =  es_03b.jpg ;                 console.log( variation two );                }             ];             $(document).ready(function () {                  pagevariations[chosenvariation];                 about();                 truck();                 $( #vid ).click(function() {                         $.fancybox({                         autosize: false                          inline:true                           height: 456                          width: 700                          href: #cab                          });                     });              });                  &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre></li> </ol>
javascript|google-maps,associating correct labels with markers in google maps  i have a little problem with a google maps page i have put together. here is the test url - <a href= http://projects.presencemultimedia.co.uk/impari/savings/map_test.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://projects.presencemultimedia.co.uk/impari/savings/map_test.html</a>    i want to have multiple locations plotted on the map by referencing their uk postcode. each marker will also have an associated label when the user clicks the marker (using openinfowindowhtml).    the test page plots the markers fine  but i m struggling to get the correct label to appear for each marker. currently when you click on the marker they all show the label of the last marker plotted.    not sure if i ve just got confused by variable scope in javascript or if there is some peculiarity with multiple markers in google maps but this has driven me mad for a little while now!    any help/advice greatly appreciated!    regards  phil
android|webview|activitygroup|stack-overflow,using activitygroup to switch between views is causing stackoverflowerror  i have a program with 4 different tabs.    one of these tabs is an activitygroup which has a listview in it. when i click on one of the list items  it switches to webactivity:   <pre><code>        lv.setonitemclicklistener(new onitemclicklistener() {           public void onitemclick(adapterview&lt; &gt; parent  view view                int position  long id) {               intent intent = new intent(tabactivity2.this  webactivity.class);               bundle b = new bundle();               b.putstring( url   urls[(int)id]);               b.putstring( prevactivity    tabactivity2 );               intent.putextras(b);               replacecontentview( web   intent);           }         });     }      public void replacecontentview(string id  intent newintent) {         view view = getlocalactivitymanager().startactivity(id newintent.addflags(intent.flag_activity_clear_top)) .getdecorview(); this.setcontentview(view);     } </code></pre>   so now we re in the webactivity class. here s the code:   <pre><code>public class webactivity extends activitygroup {     webview mwebview;     @override     public void oncreate(bundle savedinstancestate) {         super.oncreate(savedinstancestate);         setcontentview(r.layout.web);          bundle b = getintent().getextras();         string url = b.getstring( url );          mwebview = (webview) findviewbyid(r.id.webview);         mwebview.getsettings().setjavascriptenabled(true);         mwebview.getsettings().setpluginsenabled(true);             mwebview.requestfocus();         mwebview.loadurl(url);          mwebview.setwebviewclient(new firsttabwebviewclient());             }      @override     public boolean onkeydown(int keycode  keyevent event) {         if ((keycode == keyevent.keycode_back) &amp;&amp; mwebview.cangoback()) {             mwebview.goback();             return true;         }         bundle b = getintent().getextras();         string retactivity = b.getstring( prevactivity );         if (retactivity ==  tabactivity2 ) {             intent intent = new intent(webactivity.this  tabactivity2.class);             replacecontentview( list_webpages   intent);             return true;         }         return super.onkeydown(keycode  event);     }     public void replacecontentview(string id  intent newintent) {         view view = getlocalactivitymanager().startactivity(id newintent.addflags(intent.flag_activity_clear_top)) .getdecorview(); this.setcontentview(view);     } </code></pre>   i had to implement my own onkeydown because otherwise hitting the back button resulted in closing the application rather than returning to the listview.    so the stackoverflowerror seems to be a structural problem in my program and i m not sure how to go about resolving it. any help would be appreciated.

java|swing|jbutton|layout-manager|flowlayout,change overlapping of jbuttons in flowlayout  how do i repaint the farthest right card last and the left most first so the overlapping will reverse     so i have a jpanel in flowlayout which contains jbuttons. i want to emulate the feel of holding cards in hand  so i overlapped the jbuttons. the problem is that the overlapping of the images of the jbuttons is so that the numbers only appear at the bottom right corner  where i want them to be top left. this is what i have now:    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/inhid.png  alt= enter image description here >    zordering didn t work  it only reversed the order of the cards (ace on other side  king first  etc). what i want is to repaint the farthest right card last and the left most first so the overlapping will reverse.    <strong>edit:</strong> the code for constructing the hand:   <pre><code>hand= new jpanel();     hand.setlayout(new flowlayout(flowlayout.center  -45  0));     hand.setopaque(false);     for(int i=0; i&lt;p1.gethand().size(); i++){         jbutton te=new jbutton();         //button customization  icons and such         te.addactionlistener(this);         //here i tried the zordering that didn t work         //hand.setcomponentzorder(te  0)         hand.add(te);     }     this.add(hand);     }     //yes  the setbounds is long and weird      hand.setbounds(windw/2-((p1.gethand().size())*cardwhand*2/5)  windh-cardhhand-30  p1.gethand().size()*cardwhand*4/5+50  cardhhand+30); </code></pre>   this layout manager is null
java|linux|sockets|timeout|xmpp,java socket does not timeout when severing the connection  i am seeing some strange issue with my automation tests.    there is a following setup: server: centos 6 client1: windows 7 client2: centos 6    i m writing the test that simulated connection disruption to server by blocking the outbound connection on server s <code>iptables</code>. but  the behavior of socket differs on windows from one on linux client.     one thing though  in both cases there is a line of java code that does:   <pre><code>socket.setsotimeout(0) </code></pre>  <h2>scenario #1 (windows):</h2>  <ul> <li>send the <code>ssh</code> command to server <code>iptables -a output --dport xyz -j drop</code></li> <li>after approximately 60 seconds my console says <code>java.net.sockettimeoutexception: read timed out</code></li> <li>connection drops</li> </ul>  <h2>scenario #2 (centos)</h2>  <ul> <li>send the same command as above</li> <li>i tried waiting as much as 10 minutes but console <strong>never</strong> outputs the exception.</li> </ul>   so  <strong>the question</strong>  is there a way to make the behavior of socket the same (or approximately the same)     i read that <code>windows</code> actually does not use <code>so_timeout</code> but <code>so_rcvtimeo</code> instead.

python|optimization|tensorflow|initialization|out-of-memory,tensorflow optimizer variable initialization mystery and sigkill strike out of nowhere  i am trying to build my own tensorflow optimizer making a subclass of the optimizer class. but i am running into problems when trying to use it.     if i try to use it normally  it tells me that one of the variables of my model (not an optimizer variable) is not initialized but this problem doesn t occur if i use another optimizer so obviously i am initializing that variable properly and the problem lies with my optimizer. and very very strangely  it fails at the line   <pre><code>tfsession.run(tf.global_variables_initializer()) </code></pre>   to which i get the error:   <blockquote>    2017-03-28 21:21:29 422 failedpreconditionerror        2017-03-28 21:21:29 423 :         2017-03-28 21:21:29 423 attempting to use uninitialized value decoder/dec_5/fc/w        [[node: decoder/dec_5/fc/w/read = identityt=dt_float  _class=[ loc:@decoder/dec_5/fc/w ]  _device= /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0 ]]  </blockquote>   so it is attempting to use a variable during the initializing variables ... how is that possible !     so anyway  if i try to solve the problem by first making sure all the variables of the model and then initializing the rest of the variables i get something even weirder: a terminate signal strikes down unexpectidely from the heavens!!     concretely i split up the initialization as:   <pre><code>    tfsession.run(tf.variables_initializer([gs]))     logger.info( point 1 )     tfsession.run(tf.variables_initializer(tf.trainable_variables()))     logger.info( point 2 )     tfsession.run(tf.variables_initializer([v for v in tf.global_variables() if v not in tf.trainable_variables()+[gs]]))     logger.info( point 3 ) </code></pre>   (<code>gs</code> is the global step of the optimizer  and for some reason apparently in some optimizers must be initialized before the other variables)    an this gives me the following when i run it:    <blockquote>    2017-03-28 21:42:52 799 initializing variables        2017-03-28 21:42:58 345 point 1        2017-03-28 21:42:58 840 point 2        process finished with exit code 137 (interrupted by signal 9: sigkill)  </blockquote>   i get a sigkill that comes out of nowhere! ! what am i doing wrong      <strong>update:</strong>    so thanks to this answer from @mrry : <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/a/36016117/3990607 >https://stackoverflow.com/a/36016117/3990607</a> i was able to figure out that when i initialize variables in my optimizer which are dependent on trainable variables <code>v</code> then i should use <code>v.initialized_value()</code> and not <code>v</code>.     here is how my variables are created in my optimizer:   <pre><code>def _create_slots(self  var_list):     if (self._rt is none or                 self._rt.graph is not var_list[0].graph):         with ops.colocate_with(var_list[0]):             self._rt = linalg_ops.eye(self.y_dim  dtype=np.float32                                     name= r ) / self._lr       for v in var_list:         self._get_or_make_slot(v  linalg_ops.eye(gen_array_ops.size(v.initialized_value())                                                dtype=v.dtype.base_dtype) * self.q   q   self._name)         self._get_or_make_slot(v  linalg_ops.eye(gen_array_ops.size(v.initialized_value())                                                dtype=v.dtype.base_dtype) * self.p0   p   self._name) </code></pre>   i think this solved some of the problem  because now when i initialize the variables using    <pre><code>tfsession.run(tf.global_variables_initializer()) </code></pre>   i pass directly to the <code>sigkill</code> error mentioned previously.     <strong>update 2:</strong>    it seems to be some sort of memory issue. when i look at what happens in /var/log/system.log while it dies  i see:   <blockquote>    kernel[0]: low swap: killing pid 68269 (python3.5)        kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 18384 [com.apple.audio.]         com.apple.cdscheduler[265]: thermal pressure state: 1 memory pressure state: 0    com.apple.cdscheduler[44]: thermal pressure state: 1 memory pressure state: 0 com.apple.cdscheduler[265]: thermal pressure state: 0 memory pressure state: 0    com.apple.cdscheduler[44]: thermal pressure state: 0 memory pressure   state: 0  </blockquote>

android|audio|mediarecorder,android mediarecorder - setaudioencodingbitrate - howto  i tried to record audio in android. the quality of the sound using the mediarecorder really sucks. is there a way to improve quality  the documentation says  there should be something like  setaudioencodingbitrate   but i haven t found a way to implement it.     then i tried writing the sound to a stream using the audiorecord function. great quality but pcm-files are too large in size as i want to upload them to a remote server.    does anybody know how to either   <ul> <li>improve quality of the audiorecorder file or</li> <li>compress the pcm on the fly (like mp3 or else).</li> </ul>   any help is mostly appreciated.

jquery|ajax|connection,identify network problems during ajax request with jquery  i have a question about jquery.ajax request. in a nutshell i have an ajax call like the following one:   <pre><code>   $.ajax({        url: &lt;my_url&gt;         type:  post          data: &lt;my_data&gt;         datatype:  json          responsetype:  json          contenttype:  application/json; charset=utf-8          success: doonsuccess         error: doonerror     }); </code></pre>   so far so good. it works in every case but when there is no connection  in such a case a sniffer said that the request has immediately failed but nothing is called to notify me and the web page remains in loading mode indefinitely.    so to recap  i need to tell my users that the request won t be fulfilled due to missing connection.  could you please help me with this stuff. having a way to achieve connection status before to send the request will fit ok as well of course. ( i saw there is no a cross-browser solution to this anyway and i cannot implement a keep-alive mechanismm setting a timeout in the ajax request).    thanks in advance    regards
c#|wpf,periodic printing of shapes  i am making an application using wpf and c#. what i m trying to do is to print a lots of shapes on a canvas with some time in between when i push a button. at the moment when i push the button  everything just pops up at once. i have tried to sleep the thread for some time between every  print  but that doesn t help  it just take longer time before everything splash up at once. what i want to achive is that the shapes pop up one at a time with lets say 0.5 seconds in between. the code is the following:   <pre><code>   private void create_click(object sender  routedeventargs e)    {         random random = new random();         for (int i = 0; i &lt; 50; i++)         {             thread.sleep(500);             path f = flowerfactory.createflower(flowerbp  true);             canvas.setleft(f  random.next(0  1650));             canvas.settop(f  random.next(0 1000));             drawboard.children.add(f);         }} </code></pre>
php|apache|exec,executing multiple exec() from php  situation:    i have a php application where i need to get some output from exec() commands. exec() commands are used on different locations throughout the application.    when a user opens multiple pages in the same browser  the exec() commands are allways executed sequentially; if a user opens a second page  the second page waits for the exec() command of the first page to finish  before executing. if i open a second page in a different browser  or in incognito  this problem does not occur.    example test code:     $exec =  notepad.exe      $data = shell_exec($exec);     echo $data;    when running this code in the browser  the browser waits for the notepad process to close. when running the script a second time simultaniously  the second notepad process is only started when the first one is closed  unless it s ran from a different browser.    question: how can i run multiple exec() commands simultaniously from the same browser (in different tabs) while still beeing able to catch the output.    tested on apache 2.4 running php 5.4.7

c#|asp.net-mvc-3|unit-testing|mocking,mvc3 unit test controller with property injection  i have a mvc3 project that uses <strong>property injection</strong>.  within my controllers i make a call to a service class.  as i mentioned it uses property injection (with <strong>unity</strong>) instead of resolving this through the constructor.  i have searched all over trying to find an example of a <strong>unit test</strong> that resolves these dependencies within my controller but everything seems to refer to constructer di.  i’m getting frustrated.  any help would be great.    example of controller:    <pre><code>  [dependency]   public itrainingservice trainingservice { get; set; }     public actionresult index(mytrainingview mytrainingview)   {     //load all training items into view object     mytrainingview.training = trainingservice.gettraining(mytrainingview.trainingid);     mytrainingview.videos = trainingservice.gettrainingvideos(mytrainingview.trainingid);     mytrainingview.visuals = trainingservice.gettrainingvisuals(mytrainingview.trainingid);     mytrainingview.exams = trainingservice.gettrainingexams(mytrainingview.trainingid);      return view(mytrainingview);   } </code></pre>   i m trying to resolve the trainingservice when running my unit test.  i have found countless examples for mocking and resolving dependencies using constructor dependency but nothing when it comes to property injection.

c#|asp.net-mvc|redirect|flickr,how to execute certain part of code just once in mvc5 using c#   i have a view where user chooses a photo from his/her computer and uploads it to flickr. the point is that once the button is clicked  it redirects to flickr which asks for authorization  and once authorization process is finished it redirects back to that action method. below you can see some code to make it more clear.    <strong>test.cshtml:</strong>   <pre><code>@using (html.beginform( uploadtoflickr    home   formmethod.post  new { enctype =  multipart/form-data  })) {     &lt;fieldset&gt;         &lt;input type= file  name= file  /&gt;         &lt;input type= submit  value= upload!  /&gt;     &lt;/fieldset&gt; } </code></pre>   <strong>homecontroller.cs:</strong>   <pre><code>public class homecontroller : controller {         public static string tmpfilepath  filename  path;         // some other methods...          public actionresult uploadtoflickr(httppostedfilebase file  formcollection form)         {             tmpfilepath = server.mappath( ~/app_data/uploads/pictures );              if (file == null || file.contentlength == 0)             {                 return redirecttoaction( index );             }              filename = path.getfilename(file.filename);             path = path.combine(tmpfilepath  filename);              if (system.io.file.exists(path))             {                 system.io.file.delete(path);             }              file.saveas(path);              if (request.querystring[ oauth_verifier ] != null &amp;&amp; session[ requesttoken ] != null)             {                 // flickr relevant code...                  string photoid = flickr.uploadpicture(path   test picture );             }             else             {                 // flickr relevant code...                  string url = flickr.oauthcalculateauthorizationurl(token.token  authlevel.write);                  response.redirect(url);             }              return view( test );         } </code></pre>   so the point is that  i have already defined tmpfilepath  filename and path variables as static  as you can see. when i click the upload button  at at first it calls the<code>uploadtoflickr</code> method  which executes the initial lines of code  and then enters into else  which redirects the app to flickr authorization  then when i click authorize  it again generates a url that includes the <code>uploadtoflickr</code> method  which call that method again  but this time the file parameter is null  and it enters into the part <code>return redirecttoaction( index );</code>. is there any way  how can i solve this  i need the part until the if case to be executed just once  only when the button is clicked. not the second time when i m redirected from flickr.

php|vb.net|excel,i would like to track inventory level in my store based on sell through. i have data in excel format  i need help regarding inventory management in my stores. i have 30 stores in the city. i get weekly sales report in excel. i am using excel filters to find the stocks in these 30 stores. its a hard work for me cos every year no of store getting raised.     please help me  i have excel sales report. we will calculate based on sell through percentage.  for eg. i sent a 10pcs of product a to store x. and the weekly report says that 6pcs of product a sold in store x. so the sell through percentage is 60% and the stock in store x reduced to 4pcs of product a. so from the warehouse i have to send 6 more pieces to store x immediately. this is for one store is okay. but for 30 stores how many filters i have to use. i used to miss datas many times. please help me how can i solve this problem     thank in advance
javascript|html|google-maps|google-maps-api-3,how do i pan a map so all markers are always visible when a div partially covers the map  (google maps api v3)  i have a div containing the map set to 100% width and height  taking up the entire viewport. a menu animates in on top of the map. when users click one of the markers on the map  another div loads next to the menu with content.    when the content div is loaded  i want the map to pan and zoom so that all the markers fit in the remaining space that the user can still see. the div sizes are done on percentages  so the remaining space is 40% of the viewport. when the content div is closed i d like it to do the same again  this time making use of the extra space.    i m struggling to get my head around how to do this. i assume i need to define the boundaries in pixel coordinates and then use fittobounds()

java|distributed|orientdb,orientdb to automatically create databases on startup  i m trying to set up a distributed orientdb cluster (with docker) in such a way that it automatically creates the databases from the configuration file. in my <code>orientdb-server-config.xml</code> file i ve specified the following storages:   <pre><code>... &lt;storages&gt;     &lt;!-- our testing database --&gt;     &lt;storage name= testing  path= plocal:/var/orientdb/databases/testing          username= admin  userpassword= admin          loaded-at-startup= true  /&gt;     &lt;!-- our development instance database --&gt;     &lt;storage name= dev  path= plocal:/var/orientdb/databases/dev          username= admin  userpassword= alongpassword          loaded-at-startup= true  /&gt;     &lt;!-- our production instance database --&gt;     &lt;storage name= prod  path= plocal:/var/orientdb/databases/prod          username= admin  userpassword= alongpassword          loaded-at-startup= true  /&gt; &lt;/storages&gt; ... &lt;properties&gt;     ...     &lt;entry name= server.database.path  value= /var/orientdb/databases  /&gt;     ... &lt;/properties&gt; </code></pre>   orientdb  upon startup (<code>dserver.sh</code>)  gives the following exception:   <pre><code>caused by: com.orientechnologies.orient.core.exception.ostorageexception: cannot open the storage  testing  because it does not exist in path: /var/orientdb/databases/testing     at com.orientechnologies.orient.core.storage.impl.local.oabstractpaginatedstorage.open(oabstractpaginatedstorage.java:164)     ... 11 more </code></pre>   i really don t want to have to create these databases manually - does orientdb support a way of doing this automatically for me  i only want it to create the database if it doesn t exist yet  so having a script that does it automatically from the command line isn t really an option.    my only alternatives right now are to create a database manually  via the console  or programmatically  via my application - both of which i m trying to avoid here for a variety of reasons.    from the <a href= https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/blob/2.0.10/server/src/main/java/com/orientechnologies/orient/server/oserver.java#l774  rel= nofollow >orientdb code</a>  it seems as though it should be creating these databases for me. is this perhaps a bug  or am i missing something here

java|generics,java generics: warning needs a unchecked cast to conform to <interfacename>  i have an interface    <pre><code>interface x {     a getvalue(); } </code></pre>   and the implementation    <pre><code>class y implements x {     public b getvalue() { return new b();} } </code></pre>   b is a subclass of a. this works because of covariant overriding  i guess.    but if i rewrite the interface as     <pre><code>interface x{     &lt;t extends a&gt; t getvalue(); } </code></pre>   i get a warning in the implementation that    <blockquote>    warning needs a unchecked cast to   conform to a.getvalue()  </blockquote>   what is the difference between 2 versions of the interface  i was thinking they are the same.
c#,creating a updater  vs 2008 sp1    i have created a application that i have installed on the user computer. however  i want the application to be self-updating. but i am not sure if this would really update the application.    the application will download all the files from the web server  and replace the files in the directory where the program as been installed to. the user will restart the application.     i am just want to be sure  because i can t replace the installed files with the updated ones. as the application will be running. so really the application cannot delete/replace itself.    so  i was thinking that i could download into another directory  if the program is installed in this directory  program files/application/1.0.0  then i could download the files to  program files/application/1.0.1 .     however  when the program restarts  how can it know that it has to execute from the 1.0.1 directory     i can t use clickonce or the updater block for this.    many thanks for any advice

javascript|typescript|casting,how to do a runtime cast  i m on a web application that i write in typescript. in one part of the application  the use can write an additional javascript function  that will be parsed at runtime (<code>new function(function as string)</code>) for execution. the code will give me back an object which i defined in typescript as <code>class script</code>. this script object should contain specific functions  otherwise it s invalid. meaning  i want  to throw an exception  if one or more functions are not implemented by the user.    a typescript cast won t do it  as it is a compile time cast.    i thought about giving the <code>script</code> object a constructor that takes the parsed object (that  by key/values  should be a <code>script</code>object already) and check the object in the constructor for missing properties.  something like this: (this will not work  it only should show the idea)   <pre><code>export class script {     constructor(object: script) {     this.getdefaultvalue = object.getdefaultvalue;     this.isavailable = object.isavailable;     this.isvalid = object.isvalid;     this.isinrange = object.isinrange;     this.isdataformat = object.isdataformat;      for (let propertie in this){         if (!this[propertie]){         throw new error(propertie+   is missing. );         }     }     }     getdefaultvalue: any;     isavailable: (containersetid: number) =&gt; boolean;     isvalid: (value: any) =&gt; boolean;     isinrange: (value: any) =&gt; any;     isdataformat: (value: any) =&gt; boolean; } </code></pre>   but isn t there a nicer way to do this

php|session|session-timeout|hitcounter,php session based hit counter too trigger-happy  i have a simple session-based php hit counter on a website. the problem is that it seems to be adding phantom hits whenever i have the website open for some time (even without me reloading it)  so i m thinking the session timeout is set to a very short amount of time somewhere on the server. however  i have checked php.ini and the timeout is the standard 24 minutes  while phantom hits get added every three minutes or so.    the website has no nameservers pointing to it yet  nothing links to it  so it s not an issue of robots/crawlers. here is my code:   <pre><code>            $hit_file = file(__dir__ .  /hit_file.txt );              $hit_num = $hit_file[0];             if(!isset($_session[ been ]))                  {                       $hit_num++;                      $hit_write = fopen(__dir__ .  /hit_file.txt    w );                      fwrite($hit_write  $hit_num);                      fclose($hit_write);                      $_session[ been ] = 1;                  }               echo $hit_num; </code></pre>   update: i have noticed some weird access.log entries. they all follow this format: ::1 - - [06/nov/2012:22:05:03 +0100]  get / http/1.0  200 3719  -   -     i get one every five minutes or so which is about how often phantom hits get added. what on earth are they

c#|c|sin|cos,different results in c and c# with sin and cos  i wrote a program to get the angle in degrees between two gps-positions. it works fine in c#  but it doesn`t in c. where is the problem     here is the code in c#   <pre><code>double lat1 = getrad(pos1.latitude); double lat2 = getrad(pos2.latitude); double long1 = getrad(pos1.longitude); double long2 = getrad(pos2.longitude);  double angleatcentre = math.acos(math.sin(lat1) * math.sin(lat2) + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.cos(long2 - long1));  double retval = math.acos((math.sin(lat2) - math.sin(lat1) * math.cos(angleatcentre)) / (math.cos(lat1) * math.sin(angleatcentre))); retval = retval * 180.0 / math.pi; if (long1 &gt; long2) {     retval = retval * (-1); }  return retval; </code></pre>   and here ia the code in c   <pre><code>double lat1 = getrad(pos1.latitude); double lat2 = getrad(pos2.latitude); double long1 = getrad(pos1.longitude); double long2 = getrad(pos2.longitude);  double angleatcentre = acos(sin(lat1) * sin(lat2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * cos(long2 - long1));  double retval = acos((sin(lat2) - sin(lat1) * cos(angleatcentre)) / (cos(lat1) * sin(angleatcentre))); retval = getdeg(retval); if(long1 &gt; long2)     {     retval = retval * (-1); } return retval; </code></pre>   i tried it with the coordinates: pos1 (47.0998194n  9.8605694e)  pos2 (47.1004972n  9.8600639e) the correct result in c# is -26.9 degree  in c i get something like -88

jquery|html|ios|mobile,how do i load content from a server into jquerymobile pages   this is my first time here  not even registered will register eventually but i am working on an app that uses jquerymobile elements to make the ui...    it runs smoothly and everything but i want to load content from a server rather than load them up locally.    currently my app has usual ios files + htmls which make the app ui up and have buttons that execute commands. (this app will only work on jailbroken idevices).    the problem is that i don t want to link to a locally stored file that can be tweaked... i am trying to make the app as secure as possible as it will contain direct links to data that i cannot risk giving out even if some people dont know how the app works...     please help me. i am a rookie but i have been working extremely hard!     how do i make it so that a button will load a page from a site ex. domain.com/html    thank you.

java|intellij-idea,copy code with full package names  sometimes i want to copy a random block of my code that uses 3rd party libraries and share it with others.  e.g.  put it on a blog or something.  if i paste what i copy  a lot of context is lost because you can t see the packages of the 3rd party libraries.      the solution i use is to reduce this code into a small class and then share the whole class  import statements and all.  this is a lot of manual work  especially if it s just for a simple email to someone.  is there a way i can copy a snippet of code and have it include the full package paths

c#|strongly-typed-dataset,how to properly dispose of datatable and tableadapter   i have some code that retrieves a datatable  processes the data in the table  and then supposedly releases all resources again. i am wondering whether it indeed is guaranteed to properly dispose of all resources.     reason for asking is that i thought the code was fail-safe  but apparently it does not properly dispose resources when renaming the table. i know this because the access database that it connects to retains a record lock after the code has executed.     edit: why does this code keep the connection to the database open after executing when i use the table rename  and how can i be sure that all resources are correctly disposed of without the rename    <pre><code>try {    using (oledbconnection conn = new oledbconnection(connstring))    {       using (var table = new dataset.partsdatatable())       {         //table.tablename = @ altname ;  // this messes up release of resources         using (var partadapter = new partstableadapter())         {           try           {              partadapter.connection = conn;              partadapter.fill(table);           }           catch (exception e)           {                              throw new exception( test );           }         }         foreach(var row in table)         {            //process the rows.          }       }    } } catch(exception e) {      //handle.  } </code></pre>

validation|cakephp-3.0,how can i return the validation errors for a rest call   i am making a rest api for my application. it almost works  but i want it to return the validation errors when they occurs.    with cakephp 2.x i see there was an <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11184425/looking-for-invalidfields-with-cakephp >invalidfields method</a>  but it s not there anymore with cake3. i see  instead  that there is an <a href= http://api.cakephp.org/3.0/class-cake.form.form.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >errors method</a> in the form class  but i don t know how can i use it.    this is what i have in my users/json/add.ctp file:   <pre><code>&lt; php $echo = [      errors  =&gt; $this-&gt;form-&gt;errors()       user  =&gt; $user ];  echo json_encode($echo); </code></pre>   as i said it doesn t work (i know that probably form is used out of its scope here  but i don t even know if i am on the right path)...    this is the result:   <pre><code>{      message :  missing field name for formhelper::errors        url :  \/fatturazione\/api\/users.json        code : 500 } </code></pre>   what is the correct way to display all the form errors when they occour

python|numpy|scipy|vectorization,exponential moving sum in numpy / scipy   i am looking for a function to calculate exponential moving sum in numpy or scipy. i want to avoid using python loops because they are really slow.     to be specific  i have two series a[] and t[]. t[i] is the timestamp of value a[i]. i define a half-decay period tau. for a given time t  the exponential moving sum is the sum of all the values a[i] that happens before t  with weight exp(-(t-t[i])/tau) for each a[i].     thanks a lot!

android|chromium|gn,how to use android library with native library as dependency for chromium   i m working on integrating some library (<code>aar</code> that contains native library (<code>.so</code>)) into chromium (snapdragon-optimized fork to be more detailed).    in order to use it in android code i had to modify <a href= https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/android/build.gn  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><code>chrome/android/build.gn</code></a> and add 2 dependencies:   <pre><code>deps = [   ...    //third_party/libxyz_android:libxyz_android      //third_party/libxyz_android:libxyz_android_settings     ... ] </code></pre>   so i had to create <code>third_party/libxyz</code> directory  put aar files there and create <code>build.gn</code>:   <pre><code>import( //build/config/android/rules.gni )  android_aar_prebuilt( libxyz_android ) {   aar_path =  libxyz-android-release.aar  #  proguard_configs = [  src/proguard-gvr.txt  ]   ignore_manifest = true  # ignored because manifest merging is not supported (http://crbug.com/643967)   ignore_native_libraries = false }  android_aar_prebuilt( libxyz_android_settings ) {   aar_path =  libxyz-android-settings-release.aar    ignore_manifest = true  # ignored because manifest merging is not supported (http://crbug.com/643967) } </code></pre>   note <code>ignore_native_libraries = false</code> as libxyz has native libaries.    while building of chromium i got error:   <blockquote>    android_aar_prebuilt() with .so files is not supported. use ignore_native_libraries = true to silence this error.  </blockquote>   it comes from here: <a href= https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/build/config/+/master/android/rules.gni#2817  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/build/config/+/master/android/rules.gni#2817</a>   <blockquote>    assert(_ignore_native_libraries || !_scanned_files.has_native_libraries  ...  </blockquote>   is there any possibility to use <code>aar</code> with native libraries  some workaround or modified <code>rules.gni</code>  if i have to add the support myself - should i edit <code>rules.gni</code> and add native libraries copying from unzipped <code>aar</code> to target directory (it seems to be pretty simple)     <em>update 1</em>: i had to change target names and replace  -  to  _  because of target name error ( -  is not supported).
c#|performance|architecture|xna|spritebatch,xna. how to architect it so you use as few spritebatch begin/end statements as possible  im making a 2d game in xna. i started off using drawable game components and was quite happy. every sprite is derived from drawable-game-component and each one has its own begin/end statement (even each tile making up a wall). ive since realised after reading around a bit that this is a bad way to do it for performance.    now i m wondering what is a good way to do it... lets say for each room in my game i do...   <pre><code>_spritebatch.begin(spritesortmode.deferred                         blendstate.opaque                       samplerstate.linearclamp                  depthstencilstate.default                    rasterizerstate.cullnone                                    null                           _camera.transform);  for (each block in blocklist) {     _spritebatch.draw(block._txture                        block._position + block._centervect                        block.txtrect  block._color                 (float)block.txtrot                        block._centervect                             1.0f                spriteeffects.none                              0f); } _spritebatch.end(); </code></pre>   the reason i m asking is i ll have to make loads of the fields in each block public so the room class can get at them to do its _spritebatch.draw eg. block._position    i m assuming this wont really matter and performance will improve but is there any nicer architecture anyone can recommend to do this     also since that code is up there  can anyone comment on the spritebatch.begin paramaters i m using  are they the fastest ones  all i need in there is the transform

java|list|hibernate|arraylist,hql arraylist returning more than one type of class  this is not a  problem  because everything is working correctly  but it is really mind–boggling that it is working correctly and i can t find the answer.    so i have some simple hibernate hql query:   <pre><code> list&lt;comment&gt; commentlist = session.createquery( select c  u from comment as c  user as u where c.postref.id = :post_id ).setparameter( post_id   postid).getresultlist(); </code></pre>   when it runs  and i look at the debugger it returns the <code>commentlist</code> that looks like this:     <pre><code> - commentlist -  arraylist&lt;e&gt;      - elementdata - object[10]      - [0] - object[2]          - [0] comment          - [1] user      - [1] - null      - [2] - null ... ( etc  to the end it s null) </code></pre>   and i just cannot understand it  how is it possible that in this <code>arraylist&lt;e&gt;</code> there are two types of objects  both <code>comment</code> and <code>user</code> in one <code>arraylist</code>  i can assume that this is creating <code>arraylist</code> of objects or something  but then how is this possible that it returns <code>arraylist&lt;object&gt;</code> properly to <code>list&lt;comment&gt;</code> without throwing any exception  and then my method is also of return type <code>public list&lt;comment&gt;</code>  and i return this exact <code>commentlist</code>  and everything works perfectly fine.    appreciate any help.

javascript|ecmascript-6|javascript-objects,how do i get rid of automatic ordering of numeric properties   i have an object <code>newdata</code> where i assign properties to it like so:   <pre><code>newdata[ 5 ] =  test 1 ; newdata[ 3 ] =  test 2 ; newdata[ 8 ] =  test 3 ; </code></pre>   i get:   <pre><code>{      3 :  test 2        5 :  test 1        8 :  test 3  } </code></pre>   but i want to maintain insertion order of properties  such that this is what i get:   <pre><code>{      5 :  test 1        3 :  test 2        8 :  test 3  } </code></pre>   where 5  3  and 8 stay in the order of insertion. javascript objects should not have an order  but it obviously does... and this is severely messing up the loop.     i have to have keys and since javascript arrays don t support custom keys  this needs to be an object. how do i add to an object and keep it unordered as it is supposed to be

php|laravel|laravel-5.2,prevent changing subitems belonging to wrong items  i have a laravel application with events. each event contains items. events table is below:   <pre><code>+----+-------------+------------+-------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+ | id | category_id | event_name | event_description | event_startdate     | event_closedate           | created_at          | updated_at          | +----+-------------+------------+-------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+ |  1 |           1 | event 1    | event 1           | 2016-05-02 00:00:00 | 2016-06-30 00:00:00       | 2016-07-07 15:59:03 | 2016-07-08 12:26:07 | |  2 |           1 | event 2    | event 2           | 2016-06-02 00:00:00 | 2016-07-30 00:00:00       | 2016-07-07 15:59:03 | 2016-07-08 12:26:22 | |  3 |           2 | event 3    | event 3           | 2016-07-02 00:00:00 | 2016-08-19 00:00:00       | 2016-07-07 15:59:03 | 2016-07-08 12:27:04 | |  4 |           2 | event 4    | event 4           | 2016-09-01 00:00:00 | 2016-10-30 00:00:00       | 2016-07-07 15:59:03 | 2016-07-07 15:59:03 | +----+-------------+------------+-------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+ </code></pre>   and each event contains a number of items for which the table is as follows:   <pre><code>+----+------------+-----------+-----------------------+ | id | event_id   | item_name | item_description      | +----+------------+-----------+-----------------------+ |  1 |          1 | item 1    | item 1 - description  | |  2 |          1 | item 2    | item 2 - description  | |  3 |          2 | item 3    | item 3 - description  | |  4 |          2 | item 4    | item 4 - description  | |  5 |          3 | item 5    | item 5 - description  | </code></pre>   i m displaying the current events on the homepage. i want to ensure that the items belong to the event. so the following should work:   <pre><code>http://localhost:5000/event/2/item/3 http://localhost:5000/event/3/item/5  </code></pre>   and the following should not work   <pre><code>http://localhost:5000/event/2/item/1 http://localhost:5000/event/3/item/4 </code></pre>   i m solving this currently through adding some logic in my controller (for the route /event/{event}/item/{item}. the code i m using is as follows:   <pre><code>$now = carbon::now();  $event = event::where( event_startdate    &lt;=   $now)             -&gt;where( event_closedate    &gt;=   $now)             -&gt;findorfail($event-&gt;id);  $item = item::where( event_id    =   $event-&gt;id)         -&gt;findorfail($item-&gt;id);   return view( guest/items/detail   [ item  =&gt; $item]); </code></pre>   if the event id is belonging to an event in the past or in the future it will give a  not found  view. similar  if the item does not belong to an event  it will give a  not found  view.    while this work  i feel this is not a best practice and there must be more optimal methods to achieve this     relevant routes are as follows:   <pre><code>route::get( event/{event}/item/{item}   [ as  =&gt;  item_details    uses  =&gt;  guest\itemscontroller@showitemdetail  ]); </code></pre>

c#|asp.net|sql-server,how to copy the server database to my local machine to generate scripts  my boss said   to do so  script the real database using sql manager / tasks run that script locally in a query window on your own machine to create a local copy of the database.    note:  your new database will have all tables and procedures but will have no data in it.  you will need to add your own  dummy data  to make things work for you as you test.    create a second connection string in your <code>web.config</code> that connects to your local database use that connection string for your development work    however i don t actually understand how to do that.

android|spinner,how does the android system get the current selected view of a spinner   i want to extend the <code>spinner</code>-widget with the functionality that multiple items can be selected. my problem is the <code>view</code> that is shown if the <code>spinner</code>-widget is closed. i want to replace it with an <code>textview</code> that displays all selected items separated by comma.    my first thought was that the system gets that view from <code>absspinner.getselectedview()</code>  so i overrode this method and returned a <code>textview</code>  but the system still showed the first item  not the <code>textview</code>.    my second thought was that the system gets the <code>view</code> with code similar to that one:   <pre><code>view v = adapter.getview(getselecteditemposition()  null  null); </code></pre>   i tried to override <code>getselecteditemposition()</code> and returned <code>-1</code> and in <code>getview</code> of the adapter i returned the <code>textview</code> with the selected items if the position is <code>-1</code>. unfortunately this also did not work :-(.    have you got a solution for my problem     thanks in advance.

android|app-store|updates,update an android app  i have to create a custom app store for android apps. the app store application will download the applications from the server and install it in the users device. suppose the application gets updated on the server  and server sends the push notification to the device for the update.     now how can the app store application un-install the previous application and install the new one      what code examples can help to implement it      <strong>edit :</strong>    <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/users/671543/njzk2 >njzk2</a> thanks a lot !!!    so will just use the installing app logic even for update :    for installing : <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4967669/android-install-apk-programmatically >android: install .apk programmatically</a>
javascript|ecmascript-6|iife|executioncontext,why is the execution context of es6 iifes and es5 iifes different   the title about sums up the question - this is the code example:   <pre><code>!function() {     console.log(this); // global object }();  (function() {     console.log(this); // global object })();  () =&gt; {     console.log(this); // {} }();  var x = (function() {     console.log(this); // global object })(); </code></pre>   what is happening behind the scenes wrt to the arrow function  if i wanted that scope in es5  so far as i know  i would have to bind the execution to an empty object like so:   <pre><code>!function() {     console.log(this); // global object }.bind({})(); </code></pre>
javascript,how to get the total number of unique fucntions in a js script  i am looking at the source of pace.js and it has a pretty long source code of about a thousand lines. you can view the source <a href= https://github.com/hubspot/pace/blob/master/pace.js  rel= nofollow >here</a>.    i need to debug this code. is there any tool or method in javascript using which one can identify how many unique functions are there in a given plugin  i found one way which is:   <ul> <li>paste the code in a text editor</li> <li>identify each function individually </li> <li>paste a console.log( i am so and so function ). </li> <li>run the script and copy paste the result from the console in a text editor</li> <li>count the number of functions</li> </ul>   is there a easier way to do this
javascript|jquery|delegates,is it possible to find a delegated event on an element   when placing a handler to an element via <code>$.on()</code>  is there any way to find the delegated event when all you have is the target     ex:    <code>$( body ).on( click    #mylink   function(){ dostuff() });</code>    ...    <code>$( #mylink ).eventsfromon();</code>    i know this seems odd  because if the event has the delegate event data  its not really a delegated event anymore  but its worth it to ask...    thanks!

javascript|ajax|mootools,how do you get the response from the request object in mootools   how do you access the response from the request object in mootools  i ve been looking at the documentation and the mootorial  but i can t seem to make any headway. other ajax stuff i ve done with mootools i haven t had to manipulate the response at all  so i ve just been able to inject it straight into the document  but now i need to make some changes to it first. i don t want to alert the response  i d like to access it so i can make further changes to it. any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks.    edit:    i d like to be able to access the response after the request has already been made  preferably outside of the request object. it s for an rss reader  so i need to do some parsing and request is just being used to get the feed from a server file. this function is a method in a class  which should return the response in a string  but it isn t returning anything but undefined:   <pre><code>        fetch: function(site){                 var feed;                 var req = new request({                         method: this.options.method                          url: this.options.rssfetchpath                          data: {  url  : site }              onrequest: function() {                                 if (this.options.targetid) { $ (this.options.targetid).setproperty( html   this.options.onrequestmessage); }                         }.bind(this)                          onsuccess: function(responsetext) {                                 feed = responsetext;                         }                 });                 req.send();                 return feed;         }  </code></pre>
javascript|jquery|backbone.js,home/away teams with a list of players inside a backbone.js app   <strong>a. what level i am at: <em>intro</em></strong> i just finished a backbone.js course from  jeffery way . i am getting the hang of it  but how would i approach building an app that has say 4 teams (orange  blue  green  yellow) then 5-8 players per team     <hr>   <strong>b. describing the code:</strong> below is the code. i have a <strong><code>app.models.player</code></strong> model  an <strong><code>app.views.homeplayer</code></strong> and <strong><code>app.views.awayplayer</code></strong> view  then there is a <strong><code>app.collections.playerslist</code></strong> collection  then a view for the collection <strong><code>app.views.players</code></strong> which displays each player model as a list  i render the same collection <strong><code>players = new app.collections.playerslist</code></strong> inside the home player view and an away player view. i am not sure how to associate them to a team  do i create two collections  i don t want to create too many collections or too many views  i m trying to figure out how to make this as minimal and readable as possible  i need some direction :) !   <hr>   <strong>c. requirements:</strong> nothing too fancy here  i need a list of 4 teams  then 5-8 players per team(total of about 20-25 players  then need to associate them to a specific team) and i need to identify the current selected teams as either home or away. the home teams and away teams are interchangeable  i was thinking of having a list of the same teams on both side and hiding them  then the current teams that are playing will be displayed  i am just not sure if there is a better way than that     <em>final word:</em> yes i am using <code>window</code> for testing in chrome s console.log.. it will be removed when i get some momentum going.   <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;

java|generics,type t parameters in generic method arguments  suppose the following classes are defined:   <pre><code>class shape { } class circle extends shape {  } class rectangle extends shape { }  //  1 </code></pre>   you can write a generic method to draw different shapes:   <pre><code>public static &lt;t extends shape&gt; void draw(t shape) { }   // 2 </code></pre>   the java compiler replaces t with shape:   <pre><code>public static void draw(shape shape) {  } // 3 </code></pre>   my question is  if we define directly // 3 in our class then we still be able to pass <code>shape</code>  <code>circle</code> and <code>rectangle</code> reference to method at //3. then why do we need to write // 2 generic method with type parameter <code>&lt;t extends shape&gt;</code> which is untimately going to be same as //3       you can refer this link with same example : <a href= http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/genmethods.html  rel= nofollow >http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/genmethods.html</a>

c#|textbox|type-conversion,error when trying to convert textbox.text value to int32  in <code>txtdefinavalor.text</code> i can only enter values 1% to 999%  so i made code that if value is higher than 100%  change value of textbox to 100%. to do it  i removed % from textbox and made if code using convert.int32 (had same error)  then tried int32.parse (had same error).    error is  input string was not in incorrect format  on line:   <pre><code>string valor = txtdefinavalor.text.replace( %   string.empty); </code></pre>   i think as textbox after replace % for    already is integer number and wasnt need convert  but i can t make string > value    see full code:   <pre><code>if (rbtpercentualmensal.checked || rbtpercentualmedioanual.checked) {     string valor = txtdefinavalor.text.replace( %   string.empty);     if (int32.parse(valor) &gt; 100)     {         txtdefinavalor.text =  100% ;     } } </code></pre>   how solve it

python|database|concatenation|python-3.2,libraries or database concatenation  i am writing code that first reads in two .txt files into a program  and then later on i have to combine those two .txt files and perform multiple tasks with the resulting file.      as of now  i can read the files and assign them to variables  and i can print the two libraries separately  however i cannot figure out how to combine the files.    the code i have written so far looks like this:   <pre><code>def readandmerge():     library1=input( enter 1st filename to read and merge: )     library2=input( enter 2nd filename to read and merge: )     namelibrary1= open(library1   r )     namelibrary2= open(library2   r )     library1contents=namelibrary1.read()     library2contents=namelibrary2.read()     print(library1contents)     print(library2contents)     combinedlibraries=(library1   a )     # ^ this didnt work  but it was what i have tried so far     combinedlibraries.write(library2)     print(combinedlibraries)     return  readandmerge() </code></pre>   i tried appending the library with another library  but python did not seem to like what i was doing.    library 1 looks like this:   <pre><code>bud abbott 51 92.3 mary boyd 52 91.4 hillary clinton 50 82.1 </code></pre>   library 2 looks like this:   <pre><code>don adams 51 90.4 jill carney 53 76.4 randy newman 50 41.2 </code></pre>   does anyone know a way of combining those two libraries     so that when i print the combined libraries it will look like   <pre><code>bud abbott 51 92.3 mary boyd 52 91.4 hillary clinton 50 82.1 don adams 51 90.4 jill carney 53 76.4 randy newman 50 41.2 </code></pre>   these are simple libraries - if someone could point me in the direction of a way to test bigger libraries with maybe over 50 names and combine the two libraries  that would be great.
android|fft|sessionid|soundpool|visualizer,can android visualizer class be used on soundpool object   when using a soundpool audio class  it definitely has some advantages over a mediaplayer when just playing short audio clips. the two i ve noticed is soundpool is a lot faster. mediaplayer can lag a bit on startup and it s much easier to go from one sound clip to the next  where i don t have to stop reset prepare each time.     however  is it possible to use the visualizer to get real time fft data from audio data playing in the soundpool like it is for mediaplayer  i couldn t come across any topics that cover that  but by the off chance i thought i would ask because it seems like it should be possible. the documentation says  <em> the soundpool library uses the mediaplayer service to decode the audio into a raw 16-bit pcm mono or stereo stream. </em> so if i could reference the mediaplayer that soundpool is using then i think i could just use <code>getaudiosessionid()</code> perhaps      i already tried setting session id to 0 to just get the output mix. it didn t work but it s not really the ideal effect that i am looking for anyway. also one of the first things i did was try using the loaded soundpool soundid in place of the visualizers session id  but that also didn t work.
c#|constructor,possibility taking values from base constructor whose variables are different from the variables in derived constructor   it s a bit different to explain what i want but i hope that i can explain the way you can understand.    i have a class a (the main class)    <strong>class b : a (inheritance)</strong>    <strong>class c : a</strong>    class a has got my own written constructor like this:   <pre><code>public a(int a  int b  int c  string d) { } </code></pre>   let s see class b: class b inherits from class a. here i d like to write an another individual constructor which has more possibilities than the other from a.    it looks like this:   <pre><code>public b(int a  int b  int c  string d  int e) { } </code></pre>   now the compiler will probably return an error because the standard constructor in class a has been deleted. so  i have to write like this:   <pre><code> public b(int a  int b  int c  string d  int e) : base(a  b  c  d)     {        /* it s working because i ve added the variable  e  only.        the other variables haven t been changed. */     } </code></pre>   but what about this situation  class c which doesn t have to do anything with class a also wants to have its own constructor. it looks like this:   <pre><code> public c(int w  int x  string y  string z) : base(a  b  c  d)     {          /* class c does have completely different values than class a.             but i d like to have all the variables the way i ve written above.             i d like to use variable  w  for example. but  a  should be valid              to use as well. how is it possible to make the variables             a  b  c and d valid to class c  */ } </code></pre>   i hope you understand which problem i d like to be solved.
c++|python|arrays|return|ctypes,how to return array from c++ function to python using ctypes  i am using ctypes to implement a c++ function in python. the c++ function should return a pointer to an array. unfortunately i haven t figured out  how to access the array in python. i tried numpy.frombuffer  but that was not successful. it just returned an array of arbitrary numbers. obviously i didn t used it correctly. here is a simple example with an array of size 10:    content of function.cpp:   <pre><code>extern  c  int* function(){ int* information = new int[10]; for(int k=0;k&lt;10;k++){     information[k] = k; } return information; } </code></pre>   content of wrapper.py:   <pre><code>import ctypes import numpy as np  output = ctypes.cdll( ./library.so ).function()  arraytype = ctypes.c_double*10 array_pointer = ctypes.cast(output  ctypes.pointer(arraytype)) print np.frombuffer(array_pointer.contents) </code></pre>   to compile the c++ file i am using:   <pre><code>g++ -c -fpic function.cpp -o function.o g++ -shared -wl -soname library.so -o library.so function.o </code></pre>   do you have any suggestions what i have to do to access the array values in python

php|frameworks,how to structure a framework properly   i develop alone a framework with php 7. this framework is an all-in-one of multiple components that can be found in a symfony project (core of framework  orm  template engine  unit tests  ...) but that i develop myself.    my framework is based on dependency injection  on bundle  controllers  actions.    can you give me advice to improve structure of the framework      one of the most important points is the template engine (<a href= https://github.com/alixsperoza/frash/tree/master/src/template  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://github.com/alixsperoza/frash/tree/master/src/template</a>).    actually  this working is a bit chaotic.    i load template passed in parameter. i have an array of regex for each component of template engine (parts  condition  foreach  ...). i do a preg_match_all() on template with a big general regex.    i travel results of preg_match_all with a foreach. inside foreach  i have a switch with a case for each regex of component. (<a href= https://github.com/alixsperoza/frash/blob/master/src/template/parsing/parser.php  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://github.com/alixsperoza/frash/blob/master/src/template/parsing/parser.php</a>)    then  for each case in switch  i have a callextension() which calls the component. it s getting complicated when :   <ul> <li>there is a foreach. i do execute a new preg_match_all and regex on content of foreach in template.</li> <li>there is at least one parent template. here again  preg_match_all and regex when template call {{ parent name_part }}.</li> </ul>   each component has a parent class  for parsing class that he calls. by example  for generate route  i have a component route for principal parser  an other route for foreach parser and a last route for parent parser.    then  the dependency injection loads all configuration files and pass them in parameters  for this instance of di  is it a good method of working      thanks.

python|matrix|numpy,incrementing sub-sets of matrices in python  i want to increment a small subsection (variable) of an matrix [illustrative code below] - but running over them by loops seems sloppy and inelegant -- and i suspect is the slowest way to do this calc.  one of the ideas i had was to create another array of ones  of the dimensions that i want to increment (2x3 in example below) and to pad this temporary array with zeros so it was of the same dimensions as the original. i could then sum them.     not sure how to accomplish this padding in <code>numpy</code> - or if that is the most performant way of doing this calculation  i d like to try and optimize this as much as possible.   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np     &gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.zeros((10 10)) &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(3 5): ...     for x in range(4 7): ...         a[i][x] += 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; a array([[ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]         [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]         [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]         [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   1.   1.   1.   0.   0.   0.]         [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   1.   1.   1.   0.   0.   0.]         [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]         [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]         [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]         [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]         [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]]) </code></pre>
java|swing|jdbc|jcombobox,how can i prevent my jcombobox from resetting   i have a <code>resultset</code>. this <code>resultset</code> is filling a <code>jcombobox</code> with data like this:   <pre><code>databasehandler dh = new databasehandler();  public resultset klanten;  public bestellingennieuwpanel() {     initcomponents();     //removes all items from klantbox.     klantbox.removeallitems();     //removes all from productbox.     productbox.removeallitems();         try {         klanten = dh.getdatafromdb( select * from klanten );         while (klanten.next()) {             string strklanten = klanten.getstring( achternaam );             klantbox.additem(klanten.getstring(3));         }      } catch (exception e) {         system.out.println(e.getmessage());     } </code></pre>   this workes just fine. but  whenever i try to loop through <code>resultset</code> klanten again like this:   <pre><code>private void klantboxactionperformed(java.awt.event.actionevent evt) {        if(klanten != null){         string strselected = klantbox.getselecteditem().tostring();                     try {             while(klanten.next()){                 string klantvoornaam = klanten.getstring(1);                 string klantachternaam = klanten.getstring(2);                 string klantwoonplaats = klanten.getstring(4);                 if(strselected == klantachternaam){                     txtklantnaam.settext(klantachternaam);                     txtklantwoonplaats.settext(klantwoonplaats);                 }             }         } catch (sqlexception ex) {         }      } }       </code></pre>   my <code>jcombobox</code> klanten only has it s last value. i ve fiddled around with the klanten.next() function and found that that function is the source of the problem.    are there any other ways to loop through a <code>resultset</code>   or is there a way to loop through a <code>resultset</code> without resetting my <code>jcombobox</code>

python|multithreading|python-3.x|concurrency,why is this python code not thread-safe   i handed this in as part a school assignment and the person who marked it mentioned that this section was not thread safe.     the assignment was to create a multithreaded socket server in python that accepted a number and returned the fibonacci value of that number. my approach was to memoize the calculations by sharing a dictionary between each of the threads.    here is the code (with error handling and such removed for brevity)    <pre><code>from socketserver import threadingmixin  tcpserver  baserequesthandler   class fibonaccithreadedtcpserver(threadingmixin  tcpserver):     def __init__(self  server_address):         tcpserver.__init__(self  server_address  fibonaccithreadedtcprequesthandler  bind_and_activate=true)         #this dictionary will be shared between all request handlers         self.fib_dict = {0: 0  1: 1  2: 1}   class fibonaccithreadedtcprequesthandler(baserequesthandler):     def handle(self):         data = self.request.recv(1024).strip()         num = int(data)         result = self.calc_fib(self.server.fib_dict  num)         ret = bytes(str(result) +  \n    ascii )         self.request.sendall(ret)       @staticmethod     def calc_fib(fib_dict  n):                     calculates the fibonacci value of n using a shared lookup table and a linear calculation.                     length = len(fib_dict)         while length &lt;= n:             fib_dict[length] = fib_dict[length - 1] + fib_dict[length - 2]             length = len(fib_dict)         return fib_dict[n] </code></pre>   i understand that there are reads and writes occuring simultaneously in the calc_fib method  and normally that means that code is not thread-safe. however in this instance i think it s possible to prove that the code will always provide predictable results.    is the fact that reads and writes can be occuring simultaneously enough for it to not be considered thread-safe  or is something considered thread-safe if it always returns a reliabel result.    why i think this code will always produce reliable results:   <ol> <li> a read will never occur on any given index in the dictionary until a write has occurred there. </li> <li> any subsequent writes to any given index will contain the same number as the previous writes  so regardless of when the read/write sequence occurs it will always receive the same data. </li> </ol>   i have tested this by added random sleeps between each operation and making requests with several hundred threads simultaneously and the right answer is already returned during my test.    any thoughts or criticism would be appreciated. thanks.

c#|windows,what is server side rendering   what is server side rendering and what technologies are available for development on windows operating systems.     i have an application that uses .net remoting to communicate with a client app and would like to remove all dependancy on this .net component by replacing it with a server side rendering solution. the application is rich with 2d visuals  with an active x chart conrol that updates roughly once a second. i ve noticed that tearing occurs on the active x control when remoting to the app with windows remote desktop.

java|swing|hosting,how to host a java application (without using webservices)  i made a game with sockets that works fine on my machine  and now i would like to run the server on a host so that anyone can join in at any time. all i m finding are services for web applications  mine is just a swing application that can run by itself. what kind of server can i use (instead of my own machine)  would i need to change the code or is it possible to just find a host that runs my server application as is     also  note that for now i kept it simple  there is no data storage.

java|function|menu,how to access specific class   hi for one of my assignments i had to make an ackermann simulator in java and i was having trouble. the assignment was to create three variations of the ackermann project  one regular  one recursive and one through a table lookup. well  i ve done all that but the part that i m struggling with is the creating a menu for it part. i m not sure how  to access each class when i select an option from the menu. do i need a main class for every single class or one for all of them  here is my code and i guess my biggest question is how do i get user input when i select a version of the ackermann from the menu  thank you very much.    here is my menu:   <pre><code>import java.util.scanner;

java|unit-testing|methods|mocking|mockito,mockito - mocking only a method  so i have following problem:    i have a class and i created three objects of it (obj1  obj2  obj3). i assigned them various values via setter-methods in my testclass  since they will be used in a list later on.     the thing is  the class has a method  which returns a boolean  and it gets the value via sap-services  which of course i don t want to mock. so of course i want to use the when-method from mockito to make sure  they return different values  because the class i want to test  sorts the files based on what they return on the method.   <pre><code>when(obj1.method()).thenreturn(true); when(obj2.method()).thenreturn(false); when(obj3.method()).thenreturn(true); </code></pre>   to do this  i need to mock the objects:   <pre><code>@mock private object obj1; </code></pre>   and in my setup:   <pre><code>obj1 = mock(object.class); </code></pre>   but when i do this  it won t allow me to set values for the objects.     how do i do that nonetheless  i need to fill the objects with some things  i can t leave them blank. it s only that there s no other way to set the return-value of the method than to mock the object..

java|jvm|heap,understanding max jvm heap size - 32bit vs 64bit  i ve <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/171205/java-maximum-memory-on-windows-xp >read</a> the max heap size on 32bit windows is ~1.5gb which is due to the fact that the jvm requires contiguous memory.  can someone explain the concept of  contiguous memory  and why you only have max 1.5gb on windows     secondly  what then is the max heap size on 64 bit windows and why is this different than what s available on 32 bit

javascript|settimeout,javascript settimeout() slows down under heavy load  i ve created a script that fades the background color of an element. i use settimeout() to make an incremental change to the color every 5 ms. the script works great if i m just fading the background color of one thing at a time  but if i ve got  say  50 elements i m all fading at once  the speed is much slower than 5 ms because of all the concurrent settimeout()s running at once. a fade that normally should execute in 1 second  for example  may take 30 seconds if i m fading 50 elements at once.    any ideas how i can overcome this     here s the script in case anyone has an ideas:   <pre><code>function fadebackground(elementid  start  end  time) {     var iterations = math.round(time / 5);      var step = new array(3);      step[0] = (end[0] - start[0]) / iterations;     step[1] = (end[1] - start[1]) / iterations;     step[2] = (end[2] - start[2]) / iterations;      stepfade(elementid  start  step  end  iterations); }  function stepfade(elementid  cur  step  end  iterationsleft) {     iterationsleft--;      document.getelementbyid(elementid).style.backgroundcolor         =  rgb(  + cur[0] +     + cur[1] +     + cur[2] +  ) ;      cur[0] = math.round(end[0] - step[0] * iterationsleft);     cur[1] = math.round(end[1] - step[1] * iterationsleft);     cur[2] = math.round(end[2] - step[2] * iterationsleft);      if (iterationsleft &gt; 1) {         settimeout(function() {             stepfade(elementid  cur  step  end  iterationsleft);         }  5);     }     else {         document.getelementbyid(elementid).style.backgroundcolor              =  rgb(  + end[0] +     + end[1] +     + end[2] +  ) ;     } } </code></pre>   it s used like this:   <pre><code>fadebackground( mylist   [98 180 232]  [255 255 255]  1000); </code></pre>

java|spring|configurable|aspect,alternative to spring s @configurable for performance reasons   i am using @configurable beans for non-managed spring instances in a section of code that must be highly performant. we are using a lot of non-managed beans with the new operator  and in our profiling we have noticed that the use of the @configurable annotation is slowing things down quite a bit.    just for this specific section  we would like a faster way of pulling beans from the context (just a direct applicationcontext.getbean()). i know we give up ioc doing this  but this is a special scenario and not a normal pattern.    we are using ctw for the weaving  but i wanted to know what mechanism spring is using behind the scenes to get the application context so we can simply grab it and use getbean  a static application context  is it stored in threadlocal somewhere

c#|database|sql-server-2005,inserting large volume of data in sql server 2005  we have a application (written in c#) to store live stock market price in the database (sql server 2005). it insert about 1 million record in a single day. now we are adding some more segment of market into it and the no of records would be double (2 millions/day).     currently the average record insertion per second is about 50  maximum is 450 and minimum is 0.     to check certain conditions i have used service broker (asynchronous trigger) on my price table. it is running fine at this time(about 35% cpu utilization).     now i am planning to create <strong>a in memory dataset</strong>  of current stock price. we would like to do some simple calculations.    currently i am using xml batch insertion method. (openxml in storred proc)    i want to know different views of members on this.    please provide your way of dealing with such situation.
jquery,callback to .delay()  i have an <code>$image</code> that i <code>.fadein</code> and <code>.fadeout</code>  and then <code>.remove</code> after <code>.fadeout</code> completes. this is my code:   <pre><code>$image    .fadein()    .fadeout(function() {       $(this).remove();    }); </code></pre>   i want to add a <code>.delay</code> after <code>.fadeout</code>  and <code>.remove</code> the <code>$image</code> only once <code>.delay</code> has completed. i have tried:   <pre><code>$image    .fadein()    .fadeout()    .delay(1000  function() {       $(this).remove();    }); </code></pre>   the problem is that <code>.delay</code> doest <em>not</em> accept a callback function. how can i <code>.remove</code> the picture as a callback to <code>.delay</code>
java|inheritance,is extends or inherits better for this project   i m not exactly clear on what abstract classes or interfaces are in java  so please bear with me. i m coding a chess game and i have a class <code>piece</code> and subclasses for each type of piece  ie. <code>knight</code>  <code>rook</code>  <code>pawn</code>  etc. i would like methods in my piece class to be inherited into each subclass  some without new code being written in the subclasses (ie a  getx()  method) and some which will need new code (a  checkvalidmove  for each piece).    i currently am extending the piece class for each subclass  but i would like some input on if this is the best method for writing my code before i continue and go too far before i realize i should ve written it differently.
android|android-build,froyoporting  vendor & device folder  and build for a device with tapas  i try to build froyo for a given dev board  but i don t know how to configure the source tree  especially where should put the board specific code and the board configuration mkf ile  either in vendor or device      i first put my board specific code and config file in the vendor folder as:    <code>vendor\cpyname\the_product_1\</code>  with boardconfig.mk that describe my board configuration.    i then have <code>vendor\cpyname\product\</code> with the_product_1.mk to start the source tree build.    can t build with tapas  when giving product name (the_product_1)  i get an error   <pre><code>build/core/product_configuration.mk the_product_1 not found. </code></pre>   i also try with the device folder  like:   <pre><code>device\the_product_1\ with boardconfig.mk   and device\the_product_1\product\ with the_product_1.mk  </code></pre>   tapas give the same result.    note that first configuration can build and generate image with <code>make product-the_product_1-eng</code>    i also personally find the build process quite obscure and missing documentation.   please help :)    lionel

android|android-textview,increase textview number one at a time (over time)  i am interested in trying to implement a textview with a number that climbs up or down when you add or subtract a number from it.    example  start with 0.  when the user will open a dialog enter 5 and submit.  i then want the 0 to increase as such  0  1  2  3  4  5.    if it was a larger number  i would want it to increase similar to that of an animation transition  where it starts off slow  gets faster (counting) and then slows down towards the end.  that would be similar to something like going from 0 to 100.    has anyone seen anything like this implemented  or have the slightest idea of how that could work     any help would be greatly appreciated  and i will be more than happy to clarify any if needed.    thanks

php|ajax|database|forms,$_post value not complete in php file  he guyz     i am very confused because of what is happening with my form values.    at first i created a simple html form  of which i convert the values to a string. below is part of the code in my document.ready   <pre><code> var fbid = $( #fbid ).val();     var name = $( #name ).val();     var address1 = $( #address1 ).val();     var address2 = $( #address2 ).val();     var city = $( #city ).val();     var postal = $( #postal ).val();     var countries = $( #countries ).val();     var datastring =  fbid=  + fbid +  &amp;name=  + name +  &amp;address1=  + address1 +  &amp;address2=  + address2 +  &amp;city=  + city +  &amp;postal=  + postal +  &amp;countries=  + countries </code></pre>   so far so good. i then use the following code to upload this to a php file in order to insert the data into my database   <pre><code>            $.ajax({             type:  post               url:  *http://www.url.com/file.php*               data: datastring              cache: false              success: function (result) {                 alert(result);             }         }); </code></pre>   now somehow  only my last value is giving problems. this select input only puts the first 5 characters in my database. when i tried it with a text input  it shows only 3 characters(which i thought was really weird). i tried to debug and find where the problem was:   <ul> <li>changing the order of my string (last and second last value) resulted in the second last value not displaying correctly (so countries was posted succesfully(also weird:p)</li> <li>i deleted all content in my php file and replaced it with</li> </ul>   <strong>$countries=$_post[ countries ]; echo  $countries ;</strong>    this resulted in  also  only the first 5 characters to be displayed   <ol> <li>i used console.log to view the string and here the full content is displayed</li> </ol>   so it almost looks like something goes wrong in between sending the string and my php file receiving it    i honestly have know idea what is going wrong here. would love some help as i have spend the best part of a week on this now!    bye  chris

c#|custom-view|thinktecture-ident-server|identityserver3,extending commonviewmodel to include additional properties  i have a very simple problem: depending on what environment i deploy identity server 3  i want to have the logon page to display a different image. the image source location is defined in the <code>web.config</code> and transformed depending on build configuration.    i m overriding the partial <code>_login.html</code> to allow the image to be displayed  but i cannot find out how to (easily) pass into the view a variable that defines this configuration variable.    i believe that this is possible by using a <code>customviewservice</code> shown here : <a href= http://identityserver.github.io/documentation/docs/advanced/customizingviews.html  rel= nofollow >http://identityserver.github.io/documentation/docs/advanced/customizingviews.html</a> but i would like to know whether there is an easier way of passing a variable into a view without having to create a <code>customviewservice</code>.    would it be possible to extend the <code>commonviewmodel</code> and get identity server 3 to resolve this at run time   the <code>extendedcommonviewmodel</code> would be extremely simple :    <pre><code>public class extendedcommonviewmodel : commonviewmodel {   public string imagelocation   {      get { return configurationmanager.appsettings[ imagelocation ].tostring(); }   } } </code></pre>   and then use it in the <code>_login.html</code> view as <code>&lt;img src= {imagelocation}  /&gt;</code>    i realise that this would still need to be parsed into the <code>replace</code> function in the default view service  and so this is where this idea falls down : <a href= https://github.com/identityserver/identityserver3/blob/master/source/core/services/defaultviewservice/defaultviewservice.cs  rel= nofollow >https://github.com/identityserver/identityserver3/blob/master/source/core/services/defaultviewservice/defaultviewservice.cs</a>    so to reiterate; is there an easy way to pass a variable into an overridden partial view in identity server 3 without having to create a <code>customviewservice</code>      <strong>edit :</strong>    additional - i can see a hack of a solution by passing the variable in as a <code>scripts</code> parameter on the <code>defaultviewserviceoptions</code> but this seems too hacky.    would is be possible to extend the <code>defaultviewserviceoptions</code> and add a custom dictionary that can contain custom model parameters that could then be used in the view. this seems like the best solution  but would mean changing the <code>defaultviewservice</code>

javascript|jquery|html,jquery html() doesn t complete  i have a utility function to insert html into a div and then call a javascript initializer function that attaches event handlers to various elements in the inserted html.  the functions works great for 90% of cases but periodically fails in the jquery html() call below.  when it fails  the html is inserted properly but the code on the next line is never reached.     <pre><code> function loadsection(id  url  initializer = null  param = null) {         const $div = $( #  + id);         return $.ajax({             method:  get               url: url          })             .done(function (html) {                 $div.html(html);                 if (initializer) { // this line is never reached.                     initializer(param);                 }             });     } </code></pre>   the same failure occurs if i use $div.empty().append(html) instead of $div.html(html) so the problem isn t in the html() function itself. in fact  if i step through the html() code  it executes this.empty().append(value) and never returns to the calling function.     the html that is inserted may contain  to set variable values but does not call any javascript functions directly.      i ve done a pretty exhaustive search of stackoverflow and the web but have come up empty. i ve also traced through the jquery code but couldn t identify the issue.  can anyone tell me why this is failing     <hr>   answers to some of the questions:   <ul> <li> it is deterministic.  the failure cases always fail and vice versa. </li> <li> i know the code succeeded because code execution gets to $div.html(html).  and the html returned in the get is correct. </li> <li> example of how this is called:      function loadnewcontracts() { loadsection( prospector-newcontracts    ../newcontracts   initnewcontracts); } </li> <li> the initializers are different for every section.  the key points is that the initializer is never called. </li> <li> the correct initializer is being passed into the function and does exist. </li> <li> the only  tags in the html set variable values.  no js functions are called.  calls that succeed also set variable values.  there are no loops in the  tags. </li> <li> the $div variable does exist in all cases. </li> </ul>
python|r|numpy|rpy2,how to convert an r complex matrix into a numpy array using rpy2  it is clear to me how to convert a float / double r-matrix into a numpy array  but i get an error if the matrix <strong>is complex</strong>.    example:   <pre><code>import numpy as np import rpy2.robjects as robjects import rpy2.robjects.numpy2ri rpy2.robjects.numpy2ri.activate()  m1=robjects.intvector(range(10)) m2 = robjects.r.matrix(robjects.r[ as.complex ](m1)  nrow=5) tmp=np.array(m2  dtype=complex) #valueerror: invalid __array_struct__ </code></pre>   the problem persists with the following line of code:   <pre><code>tmp=np.array(m2) </code></pre>   all works fine if the matrix is <strong>not complex</strong>:   <pre><code>m2 = robjects.r.matrix(m1  nrow=5) tmp=np.array(m2) </code></pre>   thanks for any help!    ps: note that the following dirty trick solves the problem  but does not really answer the question:        <pre><code>tmp=np.array(robjects.r.re(m2))+1j*np.array(robjects.r.im(m2)) </code></pre>   ps2: it seems that nobody can answer this question  should we conclude there is a bug in rpy2
c#|.net|edi|communicator,c# .net as2 communication  i like to ask for some guidance on this topic of sending and receiving files via as2 or as3 communications protocol via a .net c# implementation.  i have search for examples or explanation of how you would implement this communication layer to send and receive edi documents as well as other types of documents.  i have built my own edi document generator and reader.  it s linked to my ecommerce systems.  we have been working with vcommerce and commercehub for a number of years.  what i can t seem to find much information on is an implementation of what the communication layer looks like for as2.  i realize the second part to all of this is the generation of certificates for encryption and decryption but i think i have an idea on how to implement that or just create the certificates manually if possible.  can you guys point me to anything that can either show me an example of the standards to use to send the http message or something like that   i have used the /n software for the communications part up until now but i would really like to do this myself so that its 100% integrated.  for anyone who needs just the server they are great and worth the cost.  very stable and easy to implement.  for me i have grown beyond being able to use them and need to build my own.    thanks so much for any help.
php|facebook,how to generate meta tags just like facebook s linter does  i m doing a project in which i have to show the project description to the app user and what i have is the url of the product  the url could be from any site it could be the product url from amazon  ebay etc after searching a lot i found that the facebook s linker does the same thing that i want for my project that is generating the meta tags from single url  after generating the meta tags i will get the information i needed from those tags but the question is how to generate those tags.     below is the code in my product.php i used to debug on facebook linter   <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;head prefix= og: http://ogp.me/ns# fb: http://ogp.me/ns/fb# article: http://ogp.me/ns/article# &gt; &lt;meta property= fb:app_id  content= xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  /&gt;  &lt;meta property= og:url  content= http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596006810  /&gt; &lt;meta property= og:site_name  content= social  /&gt; &lt;meta property= fb:profile_id  content=  &gt; &lt;meta property= og:type  content= website  /&gt; &lt;meta property= og:image  content=   /&gt; &lt;meta property= og:title  content=   /&gt;      &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;  </code></pre>   when i pressed the debug button  it generates the meta tags as shown below <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/hnf9q.png  alt= enter image description here >    i want to show exactly the same output that facebook linter generate to show the product image  description to my user.     thanks in advance
javascript|node.js|error-handling|handlebars.js,handlebars with whitespace inside throwing a missing helper error  i am using handlebars 4.x in my node application which is accepting dynamic content with handlebars in it. on compiling the handlebars  i am getting a <code>missing helper...</code> error in case the handlebars have a whitespace in it.    for example: <code>{{first name}}</code> throws a <code>missing helper first</code> error.     ideally  it should ignore the handlebar if no match or helper found  but even if it matches it against an empty value  that d do the job for me because right now  it s breaking the application.     i wonder why handlebars hasn t inherently handled this error.     now  since this content is dynamic  i cannot handle this case easily.     i am using the following regex to manually escape any handlebars i am not compiling against: <code>{{[^\n}]+}}</code>    i am looking for an inbuilt handlebars solution if there exists any which takes care of this problem for me.

android|database|image|sqlite|base64,android sqlite : take and save photo to db as base64 string... then retrieve  i would like to develop a full-proof solution to a common problem for new android developers. i want to create a tutorial and example (for myself and others to follow) to taking a photo witin an app and then saving it to base64 string within a sqlite android database. then i will be able to upload this string to an online database at a later stage  rather than the jpg image i originally took.    so to re-iterate it must...   <ul> <li>open camera </li> <li>take image</li> <li>save as base64 string to sqlite db</li> </ul>   (the reason that i need it to be stored in the db as a string  is due to the fact that this will be uploaded to a central document system at some point in the future  and large jpg images will be slow and not ideal  hence why a base64 string in the db would be better. i also want to limit the possibility that users can delete the images they take which would be referenced in the db should be just refrence the path to the file (which is the alternative - although i believe a less suitable one))     thanks  i really look forward to working on this and developing a great solution that others will be able to follow.    <strong>my efforts so far...</strong>    i have spent a number of days looking into this  and at the moment i am more confused than at the start. there seems to be so much outthere about this  but nothing with step by step sections to follow  about what line does what  where it comes from  what its doing etc. so to start with  i think i may need to break this down into two tasks now...    taking an image using the camera and giving the file as an output somehow...then saving this as a base64 string to the db or something like this.    i appreciate that usually storing binary data to the db can cause slow and painful queries  however due to the face that only a few images will ever be displayed at once  we shouldn t have too much of an issue here  and the sqlite queries are small.    so to start with i was following <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7868455/android-how-to-take-picture-with-camera-and-convert-bitmap-to-byte-array-and-sa >android: how to take picture with camera and convert bitmap to byte array and save to sqlite db </a> however the instructions to save images locally and reference the file path  really don t work. and so i was back to square one almost...    i have been reading through <a href= http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera.html</a> to learn about the camera... confused.com !!!    to be fair  i have read so much  and now understand so little  i need a dummies guide to this now. wish i could unlearn all the useless crap which i have read about this and start from scratch... where is format /f for your brain     <strong>ok so i started again...</strong>  things are going a lot better for me now  i have even added audio  but i won t get into that. my app at the moment  takes a photo  previews it (using the standard camera intent) and then on clicking save  displays it locally on the app. instead of it displaying the image  on clicking save  i need it to save to a database as a blob/bit64    <strong>here is my code so you can see where i am at...</strong>    trying to use this as the call to take the image...   <pre><code> &lt;

android|facebook,how to start facebook app programatically   i need to add a functionality on my app to start facebook
java|javafx|javafx-8,javafx switch scene in a splitpane   at the base i have an anchorpane then a splitpane. on the left pane i have a listview and depending on the list element selected  the right pane displays the appropriate content. the way i have done this is by overlapping anchorpanes and setting them to .setvisible(false) initially and as they are selected i set them to .setvisible(true) like so :   <pre><code>public void listselection() {            string selection = listview.getselectionmodel().getselecteditem();     switch(selection) {     case  speed of sound :         disableold(); // disables old anchorepane         response.settext( speed of sound conversion );         anchorpane1.setvisible(true);            break;     case  temperature conversion :         disableold();          response.settext( temperature conversion );         anchorpane2.setvisible(true);                break;     } } </code></pre>   i would like to know how to produce the same effect visually but with different scenes as i would like for each new anchorpane to have it s own fxml and controllerclass.    <a href= http://i.stack.imgur.com/v2vyk.png  rel= nofollow ></a>

python|tensorflow|prediction|weight,tensorflow: weight of input  i m trying to train a simple model using tensorflow.     goal:  getting an accurate prediction (98%+) for a new input into the trained model.     there is 500 input s. 1 stands for a price (500-200.000)  1 for a construction-year (1980-2017) and the 498 remaining are either true or false (0/1). now the 498 input s are really important (infact the other two are almost obsolete). so it s all numeric.     i looked trough the tensorflow documentation and couldn t find any tutorial on how to weigh the different input s. e.g: price/year should only make up for  10%  of the prediction (0.05 each) while the remainders make up for the rest (0.9).     how would you implement a solution for this in python  is it even possible

c#|email|windows-7|smtp,smtp email  service  i can include in my c# project   i ve written several programs that send email from c#.  this works great in winxp  but i find it breaks in win7.  my understanding is that even though the smtp server i m referencing is on another computer  the sending computer needs to have the smtp service installed (and win7 does not).      i know its possible to install a third party smtp server  but then i d need to do that on every computer running my programs.  instead  i d like to include a temporary smtp server in my project that i can use entirely from code to do the same job.  does anyone know of a library (or sample code) on how i can include a temporary smtp server in my project     here is my code:   <pre><code>public static void sendemail(string[] recipients  string sender  string subject  string body  string[] attachments)     {             mailmessage message;              try             {                 message = new mailmessage(sender  recipients[0]);             }             catch (exception)             {                 return;             }              foreach (string s in recipients)             {                 if (!message.to.contains(new mailaddress(s)))                     message.to.add(s);             }              message.from = new mailaddress(sender);             message.subject = subject;             message.body = body;             message.isbodyhtml = true;             smtpclient smtp = new smtpclient( private.private.private   25);             smtp.deliverymethod = smtpdeliverymethod.pickupdirectoryfromiis;             //smtp.deliverymethod = smtpdeliverymethod.network;              smtp.usedefaultcredentials = true;              if (attachments.length &gt; 0)             {                 foreach (string a in attachments)                 {                     message.attachments.add(new attachment(a));                 }             }             try             {                 smtp.sendasync(message  null); </code></pre>

javascript|google-visualization,how can i make the font data bold for data titles on the horizontal axis in google charts   the help that i received from other users on this forum didn t help at all ... i have a chart that is generated through google charts api on this link <a href= http://imageshack.us/f/9/capturesfn.png/  rel= nofollow >http://imageshack.us/f/9/capturesfn.png/</a>     however  the titles of the data on this column chart are so small and hard to read .. how can i make it so those labels on the horizontal axis can be bold and the fonts can be changed      the answers i got didn t help    below i did this but it doesnt seem to work .. where i am going wrong    the data labels on the horizontal axis stay the same   <pre><code> var options = {width: 1200  height: 800  haxis: {textstyle: {color:  black   fontname:  arial black  fontsize: 35} is3d: true title:  orders }; chart.draw(datatable  options); </code></pre>
jquery|animation,jquery animation: stop animating once mouse out  i am trying to make a <code>div</code> to slide out and in upon hover i.e. mouse enter and leave  respectively. however  when i hovered in and out several times  the <code>div</code> kept sliding back and forth basically up to the number of times i did the hover. please refer to this <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/sikusikucom/tqz5u/  rel= noreferrer >jsfiddle example</a>.    as you ve probably guessed  i am hoping to make the <code>div</code> stop (i.e. slided in) once the mouse is outside of the element regardless how many times i ve moused over it. i think there is something missing in my understanding about jquery animation.   <pre><code>$( #state-slider ).hover(function() {   $(this).animate({     left:  0    }  500); }  function() {   $(this).animate({ left:  -270  }  500); }); </code></pre>   thank you.

c#|powershell|authentication|proxy|exchangewebservices,exchange web services returns  401 unauthorized  when using default credentials and not behind proxy  i am creating a c#.net desktop app which uses ews to interact with our organization s locally hosted exchange server. my app uses the user s default (domain) credentials when authenticating. there is no additional auth/2-step. up until now  this has worked with no issue.   <pre><code>var exchangeservice = new exchangeservice(exchangeversion.exchange2010_sp2) {     usedefaultcredentials = true      url = new uri(_exchangeurl)      traceenabled = true  }; </code></pre>   most of our network computers use a proxy to connect to the internet. while the proxy is enabled  my app has no issue authenticating with ews. when the proxy is disabled  we find that the server returns a 401 unauthorized response. my network admins tell me that the username seems to be blank per the logs.    what is strange is that  while the proxy is disabled (on the same computer)  using powershell to interact with ews still seems to work  but using the c# app fails.   <pre><code>import-module -name  .\microsoft.exchange.webservices.dll  $exchangeservice = new-object microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice -argumentlist  exchange2010_sp2  $exchangeservice.usedefaultcredentials = 1 $exchangeservice.traceenabled = 1 $exchangeservice.url =  blah same url  </code></pre>   my exchange admin believes the ews routes are properly configured. so  we are at a bit of a loss. this smells like a network hop issue  but we cannot explain why powershell continues to work.    i did compare the trace output from both c# and powershell and found no differences save for the  tid  and  time  attributes in the  trace  tag.    is there anything else we can check

php|css|wordpress,how can i make a customizeable widget area   i know that i can go and change my theme s style.css file to change the background color of my widget areas  or if i make a custom widget area  i can give that a specific class and thus a custom background image in the style.css  but i need to give the user control for a few widget areas.      i have searched and searched and have not found any relevant information.  does anybody have any idea how i could do this   i really don t know how to make a widget area customizeable  and i would really appreciate any pointers in the right direction or assistance that anyone can provide.    <strong>edit</strong>    to be clear  i know how to add a custom widget area to my site.  i have no idea how to add a customizeable option to the widget area  rather than a custom widget.  as far as i understand it  widget areas are a set thing  are they not   any pointer to a theme that does this would be greatly appreciated  as all of my google searches only end up pointing me to how to create a custom widget area  rather than a customizeable widget area.
javascript|css|performance|facebook|cdn,why doesn t facebook combine its css/js files   i am curious as to why the facebook developers have chosen to not combine their scripts and stylesheets into single files. instead they are loaded on demand via their cdn.    facebook is obviously a very complex application and i can understand how such modularity might make facebook easier to maintain  but wouldn t the usual optimisation advice still apply (especially given its high level of usage)     or  does the fact that they are using a cdn avoid the usual performance impact of having lots of small scripts / styles

android|tabs,starting activities on tab click  i have 3 tabs which show different content on click. i want them to open certain activities on click. these activities are nothing but database reports which just need to be displayed. i used web view and works fine on emulator with api level 11 but gives an error saying <code>web page not found</code> on my device which is api level 10. also  the tabs display data only after clicking on other tabs and coming back to the first. is there a way i can start the activities directly instead of using web view     any help is appreciated.    <strong>xml</strong>:   <pre><code>&lt;linearlayout      android:layout_width= match_parent      android:layout_height= match_parent      android:orientation= vertical  &gt;

jquery|ruby-on-rails,jquery loads spontaneously on first page visit but not on refresh in rails app  i m trying to create a low-tech messaging system between users in my rails application.  i ve noticed that  inexplicably  my app loads random messages when i go to another link and then back to the page in question even though it s totally wrapped inside of an on(  click   ... ) event.  i have no idea why my app is loading the users before i ve even clicked anything  let alone why it s loading these seemingly random messages.  it s like jquery is just being spontaneous on load but acts perfectly on refresh.  i have a feeling this either has to do with my browsers cache or sprockets.  here s my jquery:   <pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {    // just a capitalization helper.   string.prototype.capitalize = function() {       return this.charat(0).touppercase() + this.slice(1);   }    // clears out data and fills in with fresh ajax   function getmessages () {     $( .message-section ).children().remove();     var $senders_id = this.id     $username = $(this).attr(  data-username  )      function messagebuilder(message){       if ($senders_id == message.senders_id){         console.log(message.senders_id);         var $usernamediv = $( &lt;div class= col-12-xs &gt;from:   + $username.capitalize() +  &lt;/div&gt; );         var $messagediv = $( &lt;div class= col-12-xs message-div &gt;message:   + message.note +  &lt;/div&gt; );         var $messagereply = $( &lt;a href= # &gt;reply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt; );         $( .message-section ).append($usernamediv);         $( .message-section ).append($messagediv);         $( .message-section ).append($messagereply);       }     }      $(function() {       $.ajax({         url:  /messages           method:  get           datatype:  json           success: function(data) {           data.foreach(function(message) {             messagebuilder(message);           });         }       });     });   }    // the click event that sets it all off   $( .messages-from ).on(  click   getmessages );  }); </code></pre>   for some reason everything works fine except for on the first visit to the page.  it works ok on refresh or when i click the items in question  but on the first visit  it just sort of pukes up all the messages.  i even tried adding this in immediately at the top line  under the document.ready part:   <pre><code>$( .message-section ).children().remove(); </code></pre>   so that it s present twice  once on click and once immediately after loading...still  the result is the same.  the same freakish behavior when i go to the page for the first time  many messages sort of randomly coughed up from the app  even though i didn t click anything.  here s what my application.js looks like:   <pre><code>//= require jquery //= require jquery_ujs //= require jquery.turbolinks //= require turbolinks //= require bootstrap-sprockets //= require_tree . </code></pre>   i ve also noticed that if i remove the document.ready portion and just put everything on the global scope absolutely nothing happens  maybe this is a clue   any ideas
javascript|html,value not assigning inside select tag using javascript  i am calling a javascript which is returning variable    <pre><code>options =  &lt;option value=   + dateval +   &gt;  + datetext +  &lt;/option&gt;  +  &lt;option value=   + dateval +   &gt;  + datetext +  &lt;/option&gt; ; </code></pre>   also my <code>select</code> element has an id= select-value  and in javascript i am writting  <code>document.getelementbyid( select-value ).value=options;</code> but it is not taking any values nor throwing any error i have also tried  <code>document.getelementbyid( select-value ).innerhtml=options;</code> but still no luck.    pfb my html code for <code>select</code>   <pre><code>&lt;select name= select-name   id= select-value  &gt;&lt;/select&gt;  &lt;script type= text/javascript &gt;    formatselecteddate();  &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>

c#|unity3d|modular,what is this programming method called  and is it bad   lately in my unity projects  i have discovered that to create a more modular application it helps to have a static list in a class that contains references to all or some of the objects created so that they may be accessed easily from other parts of the program. an example is below:   <pre><code>private static list&lt;canvas&gt; availablecanvases = new list&lt;canvas&gt;();  void start () {     availablecanvases.add(this); }  public static void addcomponenttocanvas(transform component) {     for (int i = 0; i &lt; availablecanvases; i++) {         //make sure the canvas still exists         if (availablecanvases[i] != null) {             component.setparent(availablecanvases[i]);             return;         } else {             availablecanvases.removeat(i);             i--;         }     }      //reached if no canvas found     //create new canvas or create error etc... } </code></pre>   this simply allows an object that is instantiated at runtime to add itself to an available canvas without needing to access it through a findwithtag or findwithtype method which will hurt performance if used too much.    is this bad practice or good  my colleague reckons this represents singleton programming but it of course doesn t because it allows multiple objects to exist and be used.
php|memory-leaks|curl,php curl  memory leak when using curlopt_returntransfer  the following code is in a loop. each loop changes $uri to a new address. my problem is that each pass takes up more and more memory.   <pre><code>$ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch  curlopt_url  $uri); curl_setopt($ch  curlopt_returntransfer  true); curl_setopt($ch  curlopt_header  0); $res = curl_exec($ch); curl_close($ch); </code></pre>   i finally worked out that if i comment out the curlopt_returntransfer line the leak stops.    i use  curlopt_returntransfer  true  so i can get the result of the curl operation as a string to parse. but  it would appear that the memory used to store this string is not parsed with each pass. can anyone suggest a way to clear this buffer and recover the used memory  is there a destructor i could use  i ve tried __destruct() but can t seem to get the syntax right.    thanks c
python|multithreading|parallel-processing|multiprocessing,multiprocessing full capacity in python  i wrote the following code which call function (compute_cluster) 6 times in parallel (each run of this function is independent of the other run and each run write the results in a separate file)  the following is my code:   <pre><code>global l for l in range(6 24):        pool = pool(6)        pool.map(compute_cluster range(1 3))         pool.close()    if __name__ ==  __main__ :    main(sys.argv)             </code></pre>   despite the fact that i m running this code on a i7 processor machine  and no matter how much i set the pool to it s always running only two processes in parallel so is there any suggestion on how can i run 6 processes in parallel  such that the first three processes use l=6 and call compute_cluster with parameter values from 1:3 in parallel and at the same time the other three processes run the same function with the same parameter values but this time the global l value is 7   any suggestions is highly appreciated

jquery|tinymce|attr,tinymce and jquery - attr() is returning an object  <strong>i ve solved this by using data() instead of attr()</strong>  but i d still like to know if this is just me  and what s causing it:    i m using jquery 1.7.1 and tinymce 3.5b3 (jquery package). no other js libraries.    this code outputs  string   and the anchor tag s href  as expected  when the link is clicked.   <pre><code>$( a.page_item_delete ).on( click   function(event){     event.preventdefault();     var $this = $(this);     console.log(typeof $this.attr( href ));     console.log($this.attr( href )); }); </code></pre>   when i activate tinymce on some textareas on the page  it outputs  object  and  of course  attr() stops returning an expected value. i m activating tinymce via:   <blockquote>    $( textarea.tinymce ).tinymce(options);  </blockquote>   has anyone else experienced this behaviour with tinymce  is there a known bug  or workaround  why is tinymce apparently affecting unrelated html elements on the page
c#|.net|dictionary,how to optimize a dictionary with multiple keys per distinct value   i have a relatively large set of data that lends itself very naturally to the c# s dictionary object. currently  i have 102400 key-value pairs that are being generated semi-dynamically when my program starts up. my problem is that i have to run a great number of lookup operations as fast as possible.    according to <a href= http://www.dotnetperls.com/dictionary-size  rel= nofollow >this page</a> the speed of the lookups is directly influenced by the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary. my data is a bit odd in that a great number of different keys lead to the same value. in fact  i have only 4900 distinct values... this means that i have an average of 20 key-value pairs for each distinct value.    my first instinct was to swap the keys for the values (as i only care about the distinct values in the data) then have the old keys in a list or array as the new values. this reduced my dictionary size to 4900 from 102400 key-value pairs  but i can t see any way to efficiently search all of the lists for a specific value to get the key by.    i know that my description probably got a bit dificult to follow as i switched the keys and values  so i ve included a mock-up of my data to show you what i mean:    old method:   <pre><code>key   value ---   ----- 1     1 2     2 3     3 4     1 5     3 6     2 7     2 8     1 9     3 10    2 11    3 12    1 </code></pre>   new structure:   <pre><code>key   value ---   ----- 1     {1 4 8 12} 2     {2 6 7 10} 3     {3 9 5 11} </code></pre>   in my program  i m going to be given  11  and i ll need to return  3 . the first structure is a simple lookup  but is a huge list which seems to be slowing things down... the second adds so much logical overhead to track down which value list i m looking for that i ve only seen a reduction in speed trying to implement it.    am i barking up the wrong tree here  should i just accept the speed of the larger list  or is there some other way that i can store my data to increase the lookup speed
c#|mysql|excel,fastest way to loop through sql database column against excel column - c#  i have a sql table with two columns: oldvalue and newvalue. i have the same two columns in an excel spreadsheet. i want to find the quickest way to iterate through both the database and excel spreadsheet checking if the oldvalue column in the database is the same as the oldvalue column in the spreadsheet.     my logic works such that i iterate the entire sql column (333228 records) looking for a match against the excel column which has 153 000 rows. this iteration is performance heavy and takes hours without even finishing - ends up hanging. how can i quickly do this  153 000 x 333228 = 24 billion iterations which is computationally intensive.    i read here <a href= https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/47368/looping-through-an-excel-document-in-c >https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/47368/looping-through-an-excel-document-in-c</a> but couldn t get what i was looking for. the code works and has already found 500 matches but its slow considering i need to get through 333228 records in the database.   <pre><code> list&lt;sim_info&gt;

android|sqlite,what is the best way in android to delete all rows from a table  i have a wcf witch provides some json data and then i save it into the local database. works fine i have a activity witch fills the data from a local database to a listview witch works fine.    <pre><code>public void filldata() {      // fields from the database (projection)     // must include the _id column for the adapter to work     string[] from = new string[] { todotable.column_summary };     // fields on the ui to which we map     int[] to = new int[] { r.id.label };      getloadermanager().initloader(0  null  this);     adapter = new simplecursoradapter(this  r.layout.todo_row  null  from              to  0);      lw.setadapter(adapter); } </code></pre>   what i can t figure out is what would be the best way to delete all rows prior to a sync action from a wcf.    i could do this by getting all id s from the database then find the row uri and then use:   <pre><code>getcontentresolver().delete(uri  null  null) </code></pre>   i just think that there has to be a better way i saw many examples on the net that uses the dbhelper class but i can t figure out how to access the dbhelper class from the activity or over the contentprovider    hope that makes any sense

python|google-app-engine|scheduled-tasks|google-cloud-datastore,appengine  explicitly cancelled  error  i m using google appengine and the deferred library  with the <code>mapper</code> class  as described <a href= http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/deferred.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >here</a> (with some improvements as in <a href= http://www.arikfr.com/blog/app-engine-mapping-entities-using-deferred-tasks.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >here</a>). in some iterations of the mapper i get the following error:   <pre><code>cancellederror: the api call datastore_v3.put() was explicitly cancelled. </code></pre>   the mapper usually runs fine  i used to have a higher batch size  so that it would actually hit the <code>deadlineexceedederror</code>  and that was handled correctly.     just to be sure  i reduced the batch_size to a very low number  so that it never even hits the <code>deadlineexceedederror</code> but i still get the <code>cancellederror</code>.    the stack trace is as follows:   <pre><code>file  utils.py   line 114  in _continue   self._batch_write() file  utils.py   line 76  in _batch_write   db.put(self.to_put) file  /google/appengine/ext/db/__init__.py   line 1238  in put   keys = datastore.put(entities  rpc=rpc) file  /google/appengine/api/datastore.py   line 255  in put    datastore_v3    put   req  datastore_pb.putresponse()  rpc) file  /google/appengine/api/datastore.py   line 177  in _makesynccall   rpc.check_success() file  /google/appengine/api/apiproxy_stub_map.py   line 474  in check_success   self.__rpc.checksuccess() file  /google/appengine/api/apiproxy_rpc.py   line 126  in checksuccess   raise self.exception cancellederror: the api call datastore_v3.put() was explicitly cancelled. </code></pre>   i can t really find a lot of information about this  explicity cancelled  error  so i was wondering what caused it and how to investigate.
php|forms|login,php form data to login with external form  i want to make a portal where my users can login to multiple external services. i have php form on my own website and when my users enter the data in this form  i want it to be transferred to an external website (which i do not own or control)  use the data to fill in the login form there and then redirect the user to the members-area of the external website (that i do not own or control). when i google this i get mixed results and also the answers on stackoverflow regarding this subject are a bit confusing. is this  or is this not possible      i reminds me of the principle of phishing  where one of my accounts was once hacked. i never noticed a thing  entered my credentials on the fake website and got transferred to the members area of the real website  that means it s actually possible right     thanks! sander

c#|.net|x86|64bit|anycpu,how to combine two managed x86/x64 dlls into one managed anycpu library   a third party compiles unmanaged code (x86/x64 separated) and provides managed c# .net dlls for either platform (x86/x64 separated):   <ul> <li>foomanaged_x86.dll</li> <li>foomanaged_x64.dll</li> </ul>   this is what i receive (neither native code  nor unmanaged dlls).    i can then create a c#.net application (or library) targetting either x86 or x64 and directly reference the corresponding managed dll - all fine  but restricted to one particular platform (not my goal).    my application can target anycpu (my goal)  reference the x64 dll (bad  compiler warning)  and it will work only when it actually runs as x64. again  this is bound to one particular platform.    i know  that i can combine <em>unmanaged</em> x86/x64 dlls (with fody.costura) into one managed dll by dynamically loading the approriate dll at runtime (using dllimport and manual assemblyload under the hood). i ve done this with great success  but this method is not well suited for <em>managed</em> dlls. i would have to pinvoke from managed c# into managed c# dlls - which sounds wrong to me.    <strong>q:</strong> is there any way to combine two managed x86/x64 dlls into one managed anycpu dll without pinvoke

(yes i am using php for windows).    i write this code:   <pre><code>$content =  set backup_file=database.backup \r\n  .              set pgpassword=  . cof_database_password .  \r\n  .               pg_dump -i -u   . cof_database_username .   -f c -b -v -f %backup_file%   . cof_database_name .  \r\n  .              echo done ;      file_put_contents($root .  /files/updates/backup.bat   $content);     $system = exec ($root .  /files/updates/backup.bat   $result);     pclose(popen( start /b $root/files/updates/backup.bat    r ));     $result = shell_exec($root .  /files/updates/backup.bat ); </code></pre>   the backup.dat file is created. if i run it manually from windows  the database.backup file is created  but not when i try to run the batch from php. for both command i get in $result:   <blockquote>    (string:241)  d:\data\www...\process>set backup_file=database.backup         d:\data\www...\process>set pgpassword=dom123         d:\data\www...\process>pg_dump -i -u dom -f c -b -v -f   database.backup  dom  </blockquote>   once as array (exec) and once as string (shell_exec).    then i was thinking that running bat file (even if i created in code and then delete) is not the brightest idea (security). so i way trying to backup database with sql-s (pdo - execute ...)    but i can not find any documentation if this is even possible. all solutions propose pg_dump. is there any sql command to backup entire database to file     i am looking for a working solution. sql or .bat  doesn t matters at this point.    <strong>edited:</strong>    also try:   <pre><code>$string =  export pgpassword=  . cof_database_password .   &amp;&amp; export pguser=  . cof_database_username .   &amp;&amp; pg_dump -h localhost db_name   . cof_database_name .   &gt;   . $root .  files/updates/backup.sql &amp;&amp; unset pgpassword &amp;&amp; unset pguser ;      exec($string);     shell_exec($string); </code></pre>   <strong>edited (answer on craig ringer):</strong>    try your code  i get error. <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jk0h.png  alt= enter image description here > 1: catch all for general errors from <a href= http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/advanced_bash_scripting_guide/exitcodes.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >this page</a>    for image open link in new tab to get full size.
php|eclipse|debugging|magento|zend-studio,how to do eclipse + zend (magento) debugging on local machine   i m trying to figure out how to do debugging on zend (more specifically magento) code using eclipse.    this is the workflow i d like:   <ol> <li>set breakpoints in eclipse.</li> <li>open up firefox or chrome  pull up the site in the browser</li> <li>when code hits the breakpoint  eclipse halts execution  letting me look trace everything.</li> </ol>   right now  i debug the application using debug as inside eclipse  it all works great  but i don t want to use the browser in eclipse  i want to be able to use any browser on my desktop.    here is my setup:    ubuntu 10.04.1    /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini:   <pre><code>zend_extension=/usr/lib/php5/20090626+lfs/zenddebugger.so zend_debugger.allow_hosts=127.0.0.1/32 127.0.1.1/32 192.168.15.233 zend_debugger.expose_remotely=always zend_debugger.httpd_uid= 33  </code></pre>   uid 33 being www-data.    pulling up a php test file in the browser which just has phpinfo() spits out:   <pre><code>zend engine v2.3.0  copyright (c) 1998-2010 zend technologies     with zend debugger v5.3  copyright (c) 1999-2010  by zend technologies </code></pre>   i think i do notice is when i do  php -m  at the command line  there is nothing listed under [zend modules].    i guess the process that i m pulling up in firefox is not the same processes that eclipse debug is connecting to. how do i get them to talk to each other     i would like to do this without install zend studio or zend servers since the company won t pay for anything.

php|git|bash,git add -a from shell script  after a lot of searching  i m about to tear my hair out on this one and solution might even be dead simple but i ve just overlooked it...    i m trying run a shell script from php to <code>git add -a</code> and commit everything in the repository when a button on a web ui is clicked.   <pre class= lang-php prettyprint-override ><code>&lt;  php $commitmsg =  foo ; $output = shell_exec( /applications/mamp/htdocs/gitlist/bash/gitlist-commit  .$commitmsg); </code></pre>  <pre class= lang-sh prettyprint-override ><code>#!/bin/bash cd /var/www/html/development sudo -h -u username git add -a sudo -h -u username git commit -m $1 </code></pre>   it works on my mamp/osx setup  but not on my ubuntu lts box. what might i have overlooked     on the server  i get returned  which i m guessing means that the <code>git add -a</code> command is just not working. am i right     it also works when running directly from the terminal  but not when running via the web ui.   <pre class= lang-none prettyprint-override ><code>on branch master changes not staged for commit:   (use  git add ...  to update what will be committed)   (use  git checkout -- ...  to discard changes in working directory)          modified: readme.md  no changes added to commit (use  git add  and/or  git commit -a ) </code></pre>   any help would be appreciated.

java|http|url|httpresponse|httpurlconnection,why is httpurlconnection.getresponsecode() returning 1   i have a piece of java code that opens a http connection  writes data on that and then retrieves the response code. since  the connectin was fine it should get http_ok (i.e 200) but it is getting 1 in return.    this is baffling as 1 appears nowhere in the http response code specification. could anyone throw some ideas on the potential problem area     <strong>following is the piece of code:</strong>   <pre><code>url tempurl = new url( http://www.google.com );  obj_urlhttpconnectionservlet = (httpurlconnection)tempurl.openconnection(); obj_urlhttpconnectionservlet.setdoinput(true); obj_urlhttpconnectionservlet.setdooutput(true);  outputstream obj_outputstream = obj_urlhttpconnectionservlet.getoutputstream();  obj_outputstream.write(sconfigurationdata.getbytes()); obj_outputstream.flush(); obj_outputstream.close(); obj_outputstream = null;  int iresponsecode = obj_urlhttpconnectionservlet.getresponsecode(); system.out.println( response code received is :   + iresponsecode); </code></pre>   <strong>output</strong>    response code received is : 1

python|django|http-headers,format for setting a boolean request header in django  i have created a response object in my django view by calling httpresponse   <pre><code>myresponse = httpresponse( here is some text ) </code></pre>   and i want to set set the access-control-allow-credentials header on the response to be true. should this be set with a python string like i do for other headers   <pre><code>myresponse[ access-control-allow-credentials ] =  true  </code></pre>   or with a python boolean   <pre><code>myresponse[ access-control-allow-credentials ] = true </code></pre>   or will either work  (and if they will both technically work  is one more  correct )

c#|mvvm|mvvm-light,mvvm-light: best practice for wrapping model properties in a viewmodel where set<t> can t be used  in mvvm-light  the viewmodelbase class has a set method:   <pre><code>protected bool set&lt;t&gt;(ref t field  t newvalue = default(t)  bool broadcast = false  [callermembername] string propertyname = null); </code></pre>   the goal of that method is to encapsulate various side effects that you might want to occur as a result of setting a property (property change notification  messaging  etc).    i want to expose the properties of my model via properties in the viewmodel by delegating to the model s getter/setter.  e.g.  for the student (model)  i am currently implementing the student.name wrapper in the viewmodel like this:   <pre><code>public class viewmodelbasewrapped&lt;t&gt; : viewmodelbase where t: domainobject {     public viewmodelbasewrapped(t wrapped) {         m_wrappeddomainobject = wrapped;     }      private t m_wrappeddomainobject;     protected t wrapped { get { return m_wrappeddomainobject; } } }  public class studentviewmodel : viewmodelbasewrapped&lt;student&gt; {     public studentviewmodel(student wrapped) : base(wrapped) { }     public string firstname {         get { return wrapped.firstname; }         set { wrapped.firstname = value;  }     } } </code></pre>   however  i would prefer to use viewmodelbase s set function as so  to get access to the additional encapsulated functionality:   <pre><code>public class studentviewmodel : viewmodelbasewrapped&lt;student&gt; {     public studentviewmodel(student wrapped) : base(wrapped) { }     public string firstname {         get { return wrapped.firstname; }         set { set(ref wrapped.firstname  value);  }     } } </code></pre>   that is illegal  however  because you can t pass a property of an object by ref.  can anyone think of a way to use the set architecture while still being able to defer to the model for use as the backing store
java|hadoop|machine-learning|classification|mahout,how do i classify numerical data in apache mahout   i have a numerical dataset of the format <code>class  unigram count  bigram count  sentiment</code>. i went through some of the apache mahout documentation and it was all about text data. i am aware that i need to perform 3 steps to classify: convert to sequence files  vectorize sequence files  pass it to train the naive bayes classifier. but i am having a hard time to understand the difference between classifying a text dataset vs classifying a numerical dataset in mahout. what do i need to do differently in my case  i would appreciate any help.

android|layout,android mapview + buttons at the bottom  <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/ubxal.jpg  alt= map ui >    i am trying to get a result similar to above but i am having difficulties getting the layout to reflect it. so far i have managed to get the buttons to sit at the top fine but as soon as i want to move them to the bottom i can either only get them to be overlay or just completely disappear.    i m sure it s a pretty simple layout but i can t for the life of me get it.    the main view is a mapview  i want the mapview to give the buttons some space and basically just have the app background at the back of it.
javascript|html5|frameset,emulate frameset separator behavior  the html5 current specification removed the <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code> tag.    there is a nice feature of <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code> which is not easy to reproduce without it:    in a frameset  you can change the position of the line separating the frames with the mouse.     how would i  provide the same functionality with with using divs in javascript     i ve come across <a href= http://www.jsfiddle.net/gaby/bek9l/  rel= nofollow >the following</a> which demonstrates the behavior i m looking for. however i would like to avoid using jquery  even though using jquery should be the preferred way.
c#|asp.net-mvc|json,httppost in asp.net mvc 4  i am testing a push notification on a calendar application. when i create an event on calendar application  my website gets a httppost request with a json string. i wrote code like this but i couldn t receive the json string in my action method.   <pre><code>       [httppost]        public actionresult push(string jsonreq)        {          console.write(jsonreq);          return view();        } </code></pre>   when i create model in the same structure as json  then i can receive the request. it seems to be tightly coupled to json structure   i am using in asp.net mvc 4.    <pre><code>     [httppost]     public actionresult push(jsonmodel jsonmodel)     {          return view();     } </code></pre>
java|cas|jasig,jasig cas login without cas login screen  we are trying to use cas server for sso for our existing web based applications. our goals are   <ul> <li>achive sso across the various applications (including cross domain).</li> <li>have customized login (in ui terms) pages for different apps  when they are redirected to cas server login page.</li> <li>ability to do login without going to the cas login page  reason being  a small login  section  is embedded in the page itself and user will not be redirected to the cas login page for better usability.</li> </ul>   we are done with the first and second goal. but having problems with third one.    for this functionality we are trying to replicate the same actions as in second goal   only difference being submitting/posting the data (credentials   login tickets etc) from non cas login page.   <ul> <li>we cannot use iframes to show the cas login page in the small section   this is vulnerable to browser compatability issues.</li> <li>we cannot use ajax to use cas api s to getting the login ticket and doing the http post (cross domain issue)</li> <li>what we have done is : retrieve the loginticket and execution id on the load of the non cas login page by doing an http post on the server side. when we post the username / password along with the loginticket and execid   the cas server instead of accepting the post data redirects the user to cas login page but doing a browser back and submitting the data again works fine. reasons is no jsession extablished between the cas and the browser and hence cas rejects any post data. we can use the cas restapi but it will just login the user and no help in getting the sso done.</li> </ul>   any thoughts on how can we handle this problem       thanks  pratik

javascript|jquery|date,updating multiple span text from respective value with jquery each  i have a bunch of timestamps in my page that i want javascript to convert to the user s local timezone. in my template  i drop the timestamps in iso format into a special span class  and want to iterate over each span to do the conversion. here s my code:   <pre><code>$( .tzdate ).each( function(){     $(this).text( date( $(this).val() ) );   }); </code></pre>   the conversion works perfectly. the only problem is that every single span is updated to the same value. i thought using $(this) inside of an $.each() would work but it doesn t seem to in either chrome or firefox.     any suggestions      [edit]<br> vision s answer got me started  because it is now actually doing the date conversion and not just using the timestamp at the time the script was run. now the problem is setting the text to the date doesn t seem to be working. some updated code:   <pre><code>$(  .tzdate  ).each(function( index ) {   console.log( index +  :   + $(this).text() );   console.log( index +  :   + new date( $(this).text() ) );   var a = new date( $(this).text() )   $(this).text ( a )  }); </code></pre>   output:   <pre><code>0: 2013-01-24t18:42:21 0: thu jan 24 2013 13:42:21 gmt-0500 (est) 1: 2013-01-24t18:35:08 1: thu jan 24 2013 13:35:08 gmt-0500 (est) 2: 2013-01-24t18:42:21 2: thu jan 24 2013 13:42:21 gmt-0500 (est) 3: 2013-01-24t18:40:27 3: thu jan 24 2013 13:40:27 gmt-0500 (est) </code></pre>   but the span s text doesn t actually update. thoughts  thanks!

c#|coderush,why does coderush warn me of an unused declaration in code   i have this code  which i use all over my applications to save data back to the database.    <pre><code>    public bool savedemo()     {         bool success = false;          try         {             using (datatable dt = dataaccess.executedatatable( [dbo].[udp_customers_ups]                   dataaccess.parameter(customeridcolumn  customerid)                  dataaccess.parameter(codecolumn  code)                  dataaccess.parameter(companycolumn  company)                  dataaccess.parameter(isdeletedcolumn  isdeleted)                  dataaccess.parameter(lastupdatedcolumn  lastupdated)                  dataaccess.parameter(updatedbycolumn  updatedby)))                  success = true;         }         catch         {             success = false;         }          return success;     }  </code></pre>   the code works as is  which by that i mean it saves the data back to the database. however coderush complains about the dt being an unused declaration.  and since the using is (i think) using the dt i would think that the warning is a false positive. so i am left wondering if coderush is wrong or if i am missing something
javascript|jquery|twitter-bootstrap|backbone.js|coffeescript,backone events off of bootstrap modal  so i recently had to make a change to css that made a view that holds a backbone modal <code>position: fixed;</code>. this of course caused the problem of the modal appearing behind the backdrop as this so <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10636667/bootstrap-modal-appearing-under-background#_=_ >outlines</a>.    now i can t necessarily change the css without messing up the app  so i opted to go the route of when the user clicks the modal button to append the modal to the body:   <pre><code> events:          click .share :  adjustmodal       adjustmodal: -&gt;         $( #shareaccessmodal ).appendto( body ) </code></pre>   this works great. however  i now seem to no longer be hitting events triggered from the modal.    previously this worked great:   <pre><code>events:              keyup [type= text ]#sharedaccess :  updateemail   updateemail: (e) -&gt;             if e.keycode == 13 &amp;&amp; e.currenttarget.value !=                    $( p ).remove()                 if @model.get( email )                     @email = @model.get( email )    +  |  + e.currenttarget.value                 else                     @email = e.currenttarget.value                 array = @email.split( | )                 for email  i in array                      $( .emails ).append( &lt;p&gt;  + email +   &lt;button type= button  class= close  &gt;&lt;span aria-hidden= true &gt;&amp;times;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class= sr-only &gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt; )                  e.currenttarget.value =    </code></pre>   but now updateemail never seems to be getting called.     here s my template:   <pre><code>&lt;div class= container &gt;     &lt;a id= back  href= # &gt;       &lt;i class= fa fa-chevron-left &gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;div class= message &gt;&lt;%= @title %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class= btn btn-inline pull-right continue &gt;continue&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class= btn btn-inline pull-right share  data-toggle= modal  data-target= #shareaccessmodal &gt;&lt;i class= fa fa-share &gt;&lt;/i&gt; share access&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class= modal fade  id= shareaccessmodal  tabindex= -1  role= dialog  aria-labelledby= mymodallabel  aria-hidden= true &gt;   &lt;div class= modal-dialog &gt;     &lt;div class= modal-content &gt;       &lt;div class= modal-header &gt;         &lt;button type= button  class= close  data-dismiss= modal &gt;&lt;span aria-hidden= true &gt;&amp;times;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class= sr-only &gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;         &lt;h4 class= modal-title  id= mymodallabel &gt;grant access&lt;/h4&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;       &lt;div class= modal-body &gt;         &lt;input type= text  id= sharedaccess  class= shared-access  placeholder= enter email addresses of users allowed to edit/view &gt;         &lt;div class= emails &gt;             &lt;h3&gt;users with access:&lt;/h3&gt;             &lt;% for email  i in @email.split( | ): %&gt;                 &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= email %&gt; &lt;button type= button  class= close  &gt;&lt;span aria-hidden= true &gt;&amp;times;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class= sr-only &gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;             &lt;% end %&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;       &lt;div class= modal-footer &gt;         &lt;button type= button  class= btn btn-default  data-dismiss= modal &gt;cancel&lt;/button&gt;         &lt;button type= button  class= btn btn-primary  data-dismiss= modal &gt;save&lt;/button&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   any idea how i should change my code so that i can still act on events triggered from the view  namely pressing enter in the text field.
c#|pdf|text|itextsharp|extraction,itextsharp reading paragraphs only  i am using <code>itextsharp</code> to read pdf files using c#. the text extraction using <code>pdftextextractor.gettextfrompage()</code> function returns all text as expected.    but for a pdf which has say  table of content  index &amp; say page number should be dropped. and i just want to get the paragraph of text.    i checked for availability of options by exploring the <code>itextextractionstrategy</code>.    i am really clueless and any pointers will help.    i explored to isolate the fields using <code>acrofields</code>  but that looks like a long shot.    thank you.    regards  ~mayur

java|tomcat|ssl|https,ssl connection from java client  i m creating a java client program that will be sending sensitive information to a tomcat server.  so i need to use ssl connection so information will be encrypted.    i need to use self-signed untrusted certificate but having problems making connection from java client.    i have successfully setup tomcat 5.5 to use ssl and tested it through firefox  which displays warning of self-signed certificate.    i followed the tomcat 5.5 ssl setup and they mentioned to create a keystore:   <blockquote>    <code>keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg rsa</code>  </blockquote>   then i did an export of the above:   <blockquote>    <code>keytool -export -keystore .keystore -alias tomcat -file localhost.cer</code>  </blockquote>   then i did an import of the above certificate into client machine:   <blockquote>    <code>keytool -import -alias tomcat -file localhost.cer -keystore  c:\program files \java\jdk1.6.0_17\jre\lib\security\cacerts </code>  </blockquote>   but when running client i get:   <blockquote>    exception in thread  main  javax.net.ssl.sslhandshakeexception: sun.security.validator.validatorexception: pkix path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.suncertpathbuilderexception: unable to find valid certification path to requested target  </blockquote>   this is the client code:   <pre><code>url url = new url( https://localhost:8443 ); httpsurlconnection conn = (httpsurlconnection)url.openconnection(); conn.setsslsocketfactory(sslsocketfactory); inputstream inputstream = conn.getinputstream(); </code></pre>   now i just started playing with these certificates today and i m new to keystores  so please be patient.    can someone please explain how to export and import the certificate created in tomcat to client machine     thank you.

android|image|audio|gallery,android image gallery  i m new to android and creating an image gallery project    i ve create a rotating image gallery successfully     now i wish to play a sound file but what is happening is that as soon as the image is changed  the music interrupts or stops    i ve tried to play the music in different thread but of no use. here is my code: <code>   <pre><code>public class mainactivity extends activity { timer timer; timertask task; int cnt = -1; imageview icon;          string[] images = { alienaquacamera    alienaquadesktop   alienaquaexcel };  @override public void oncreate(bundle savedinstancestate) {     super.oncreate(savedinstancestate);     setcontentview(r.layout.activity_main);      icon = (imageview) findviewbyid(r.id.img);              mediaplayer mplayer = mediaplayer.create(mainactivity.this  r.raw.ghatotkach);     mplayer.start();      final handler mhandler = new handler();      // create runnable for posting     final runnable mupdateresults = new runnable() {         public void run() {             changeimage();         }     };              timer = new timer();      task = new timertask() {          @override         public void run() {             mhandler.post(mupdateresults);         }     };      timer.schedule(task  0  3000); }  public void changeimage(){       ++cnt;      if(cnt==images.length)         cnt = 0;      resources res = getresources();      string drawablename = images[cnt];      int resid = res.getidentifier(drawablename    drawable   getpackagename()); system.out.println( cnt =   + cnt +     image =   + drawablename +     id =   + resid);     if(resid&gt;0)         icon.setimageresource(resid); } } </code></pre>   </code> i m not able to understand what is wrong
jquery|html,animate div to overlap on top of another div on click  then return to previous div on click  trying to navigate between divs on click (sliding out from the side using animate). i ve somewhat got it to work  but i need it to  start over  when you are back at the main menu  which it currently does not do.     right now you can click the menu icon (which for some reason you have to click twice) to open the side menu. then if you click on  more articles >  the next menu appears. clicking the &lt;&lt; arrows at the top takes you back to the main menu  but if you try and click on  more articles >  again  it doesn t open. also  if you close the menu all together and try to re-open it  it does not work either...     any suggestions on a better <em>cleaner</em> way to do this would be much appreciated. so far  this this is the code i m using:    html   <pre><code>&lt;div class= triggerbox &gt;&lt;a href= #  id= trigger &gt;≡&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class= menu &gt;         &lt;h2&gt;programs&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;ul&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;page&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;page&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;page&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt;         &lt;h2&gt;pages&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;ul&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;page&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;page&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;page&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a id= interior-trigger  href= # &gt;page with children &gt; &lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt;         &lt;h2&gt;college&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;ul&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;full site&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;apply&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class= interior-menu &gt;         &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id= back  href= # &gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/a&gt;articles&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;ul&gt;         &lt;li&gt;article&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;article&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;article&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;article&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;article&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;article&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   css   <pre><code> body {     font-family: open sans condensed   sans-serif;     font-size:12px; } .menu  .interior-menu {     position:fixed;     top:0px;     right:-360px; } .interior-menu {     display:none;  .menu ul  .interior-menu ul {     display:block;     list-style-type:none;     width:300px;     height:100%;     padding:0px;     margin:0px; } </code></pre>   and my script   <pre><code>// slide open and close the main menu $( #trigger ).click(function () {     $( .menu ).animate({          right :  0px                width :  toggle      }      100); }); //hide the interior menu $( #interior-menu ).hide();  //after clicking on a page with children  slide out the main panel $( #interior-trigger ).click(function () {     $( .menu ).animate({          right :  0px                width :  0px      }      30);      //slide out the parent page s child menu      $( .interior-menu ).animate({          right :  0px                width :  toggle      }      30); }); </code></pre>   please see fiddle: <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/j4n38/  rel= nofollow >http://jsfiddle.net/j4n38/</a>    thanks in advance.

python|python-3.x|order|scikit-learn|nltk,retain ordering of text data when vectorizing  i am attempting to write a machine learning algorithm with <code>scikit-learn</code> that parses text and classifies it based on training data.    the example for using text data  taken directly from the <code>scikit-learn</code> documentation  uses a <code>countvectorizer</code> to generate a sparse array for how many times each word appears.   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import countvectorizer &gt;&gt;&gt; count_vect = countvectorizer() &gt;&gt;&gt; x_train_counts = count_vect.fit_transform(twenty_train.data) </code></pre>   unfortunately  this does not take into account any ordering of the phrases. it is possible to use larger <code>ngrams</code> (<code>countvectorizer(ngram_range=(min  max))</code>) to look at specific phrases  but this increases the number of features rapidly and isn t even that great.    is there a good way of dealing with ordered text in another way  i m definitely open to using a natural language parser (<code>nltk</code>  <code>textblob</code>  etc.) along with <code>scikit-learn</code>.
javascript|sorting|decimal-point,sorting  numbers  with multiple decimal points  i ve got a bunch of  numbers  that have multiple decimal points (so they re really strings). however  i want to sort them as if they were numbers.   <pre><code>1.1.1 10.2.3 2.6.7 21.10.4 3.10.12 4.11.5 4.1.16 6.4.23 </code></pre>   i want them to sort by the first set of numbers (before the first decimal point)  then by the second set  then by the third (with the possibility of it continuing for a fourth set or more). they should go in this order:   <pre><code>1.1.1 2.6.7 3.10.12 4.1.16 4.11.5 6.4.23 10.2.3 21.10.4 </code></pre>   what is the best way to do this using js  i m thinking i ll probably need to break each number into an array  but there maybe a better way. ideas

c#|ios|xcode|unity3d,unity3d  c#. input does not work on ios simulator  i m new to ios and just tried to make the simplest game just for test it on ios simulator. here is the all code   <pre><code>using unityengine; using system.collections;  public class controller : monobehaviour {  private rigidbody2d rb;  // use this for initialization void start () {     rb = transform.getcomponent&lt;rigidbody2d&gt;(); }  // update is called once per frame void update () {     if(input.getmousebutton(0) || input.touchcount &gt; 0)     {         rb.addforce(vector2.up  forcemode2d.impulse);     } } } </code></pre>   as you see  when user press the button or just touch the screen  some object fly up.    of course in unity it works fine  but when i make ios build (with ios simulator sdk) and try to run it in xcode it runs  but when i press a mouse button - controlled object does not fly up.    <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch v=1wpg_qnxrsa  rel= nofollow >here is the video of all that process.</a>    what could be the problem  why it doesn t work
java|exception,java - issue with exceptions  i m having some trouble getting my code to compile.    this is a method  that uses the class value to save text to a file   <pre><code>public void saveeventstofile() throws exception {     string tmp = geteventsasstring();     value = value.makestring(tmp);     value.savefile(value   \\events  +  \\  +  year  +  \\  + months[month] +  \\  + day); } </code></pre>   and this is part of a constructor of another object. i ve got an actionlistener on a button (ok) and when that button is pressed  i want to call the saveeventstofile method.   <pre><code>ok.addactionlistener(new actionlistener() {         public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {             int h  m;             h = (integer) hourspinner.getvalue();             m = (integer) minutespinner.getvalue();             parentpanel.createnewevent(parentpanel.selectedbox  parentwindow        textpane.gettext()  h  m);             parentpanel.selectedbox.saveeventstofile();             dispose();         }     }); </code></pre>   if i add throws exception on actionperformed my code does not compile  and without it i get  unhandled exception  error on the arentpanel.selectedbox.saveeventstofile(); line    how could i get this to compile  i ve not had much experience with exceptions.

android|browser,is it possible to count the number of times i open google   i want to develop an application (or service) that will count the number of times i open <code>http://www.google.com</code> url. but i do not know if this is possible with android.    i want to do a research on this field but i do not know how to start. as far i was looking  there is no intent fired when some uri in the browser is oppened  but i guess there is so way to do this. i do not expect to be simple but i hope it is possible. my hope is the fact that some applications measure the network traffic  meaning everything is somehow tracked.
jquery|css|greensock,animating a line  i have a line object that i m trying to animate using timelinelite.  since the first parameter in a timeline function is the element  how would i do this using the line object    <pre><code>function animatedline(name  x1  y1  x2  y2  stroke  width  duration){     this.name = name;     this.x1 = x1;     this.x2 = x2;     this.y1 = y1;     this.y2 = y2;     this.stroke = stroke;     this.width = width;     this.duration = duration; } var line1 = new animatedline( r01   0  0  0  100   black   3  3); </code></pre>   so basically  the line is going to have a starting point of x1  y1.  or  <code>({ left : x1   top : y1})</code>  how do i make the line animate vertically so that the height equals the value of <code>y2</code> and the width of the line equals the value of <code>width</code>
java|mysql|sql|netbeans|jdbc,selecting values from a database with a query in java and use them as a variable and insert it in another table  so i selected some values from a database table to divide them in little groups and insert it into another table within the database by putting the selected values in an <code>arraylist</code> and taking the size of that <code>arraylist</code> to do the math.    but after i do the math  i m just left with the variables containing the information i need. but  i cant put them into the other table because they re not the same things that i selected in the beginning. they re just numbers now. i really need to insert those variables into the other table but when i do  i get foreign key constraint fails error and i think that s because the variable is not a foreign key anymore but just a number. i don t know if there is a solution but it would help me allot. here is my code:   <pre><code>private void spelersverdelenmouseclicked(java.awt.event.mouseevent evt) {                                               string comboboxvalue = jcomboboxdeelnemer.getselecteditem().tostring(); string spelerronde1 =  select lid  toernooi from deelnemer where     toernooi like   + comboboxvalue ;   arraylist&lt;string&gt; dlnmrs = new arraylist&lt;&gt;(); try {    preparedstatement pstat = con.preparestatement(spelerronde1);   resultset rs = pstat.executequery();     while (rs.next()) {          dlnmrs.add(rs.getstring( lid ));         for (int i = 0; i &lt; dlnmrs.size(); i++) {         }     }  } catch (exception e) {     joptionpane.showmessagedialog(rootpane e); }  verdeeltafels(1  dlnmrs.size());   private void verdeeltafels(int ronde  int aantaldeelnemers) {  system.out.println(aantaldeelnemers);  int aantaltafels = (int) aantaldeelnemers / aantal_spelers_per_tafel; int restspelerperronde = aantaldeelnemers % aantal_spelers_per_tafel;  if (aantaldeelnemers == (aantal_spelers_per_tafel * 2)) {     aantaltafels = 1;     restspelerperronde = 0; }  for (int i = 0; i &lt; aantaltafels; i++) {     int maxspelerspertafel = aantal_spelers_per_tafel;     if (i == aantaltafels - 1) {         maxspelerspertafel += restspelerperronde;     }     system.out.println( tafel   + (i + 1) +   heeft   + maxspelerspertafel +   deelnemers. );      //spelersdoorlopen      for (int j = 0; j &lt; maxspelerspertafel; j++) {    string query =  insert into spelerpertafel (lid tafel ronde) select lcode tfcode rcode from lid tafel ronde  ;   try{           preparedstatement pstat = con.preparestatement(query);           pstat.execute(query);       }   catch (exception e) {     joptionpane.showmessagedialog(rootpane e);         system.out.println(e);       }       }    }  } </code></pre>
python|input|pygame,get inputs without focus in python/pygame   i am creating a small app for myself to be able to show my keyboard inputs and show them in a joystick layout  like this:    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzdel.jpg  alt= current view of my app >    this itself  works perfectly fine while the pygame windows is focused  my problem is  i can t have this focused all the time  in fact it will never have focus because either way i will be using obs to stream or i will be using my emulator  and pygame doesn t detect inputs that are out of the window. is there any way to make python or pygame read all the input made to the computer    i am hitting a wall here. thanks in advance!!

javascript|json|rest|node.js|express,what is a possible format for complex post parameters in a restful api   i m developing an application using <code>node.js</code> + <code>express</code> which contains a structure allowing the user to subscribe to lists of items.  each list subscription involves options such as the minimum score for each item and the top n items in the list  and the subscriptions can be organized into numeric groupings which relate to a particular rank in the overall subscribed lists schema.  multiple subscriptions can be in a single rank  allowing for ties  while others may rank higher or lower.    my current issue is that i m providing an interface for managing these list subscriptions and their options  and while i can think of a few ui possibilities i m a little stumped about the best format for submitting the results back to my server.    represented as json  this is what i would be working with:   <pre><code>[     [         { list_id :1  min_score :0  limit :500}     ]      [         { list_id :12  min_score :5  limit :-1}          { list_id :16  min_score :5  limit :-1}     ]      [         { list_id :2  min_score :0  limit :-1}     ] ] </code></pre>   i m tempted to simply encode that json and post it as a single param  but that sounds a bit hack-ish.  i m trying to keep my api as open and consistent as possible to allow for other clients.
c#|class-design,class design question  let s say i want to make a humanbody class. and i want to store the length of each limb.    <pre><code>humanbody.leftarmlength = 14; humanbody.rightarmlength = 14.1; humanbody.leftleglength = 32; humanbody.rightleglength = 31.9; </code></pre>   that s all well and good  but it seems like it would be better to do something like:   <pre><code>humanbody.arm.left.length = 14; humanbody.arm.right.length = 14.1; humanbody.leg.left.length = 32; humanbody.leg.right.length = 31.9; </code></pre>   so this would involve making sub classes.  is what i m describing something that is considered a  good practice    it seems like this is a more organized way to store data.     edit: this example is quite simple  but if there are 100 different pieces of data to store  this seems like a much better method to use.
java|clojure|audio|fft|spectrum,clojure/java: java libraries for spectrum analysis of sound   i am looking for a library that can accept a chunk of audio data and return the average amplitude over time within a given frequency band.    i ve already asked this question over at comp.dsp  but it s clear to me that acquiring the know-how to build this on my own using a basic fft library is going to require more time and energy than i have at present. here is my original question with more detai: <a href= http://groups.google.com/group/comp.dsp/browse_thread/thread/e04f78d439e9e2bd  rel= noreferrer >http://groups.google.com/group/comp.dsp/browse_thread/thread/e04f78d439e9e2bd</a>    i ve found lots of nice libraries for playing with sound (i used jsyn in the past)  but none of these seem to be set up to return quick and dirty spectral information about a sound sample.    any pointers would be much appreciated.
python|fonts|svg|font-size,how to get the size of a single character in a (web) font   i write a python script in order to generate a svg file. this svg file uses a web font ( imported from google webfonts via css ) to render my texts nicely. everything is fine except i need to know the size (in pixel) of a sentence before putting it in my svg file.     as i started learning python few days ago  i don t know if this kind of stuff is possible. google helped me to find the existence of the imagefont python module (from the python imaging library) but it seems imagefont needs to load font file from a local path in order to compute character size.    is there any chance a way to compute character size on a web font exists       thank you for your help.

javascript|jquery|jquery-animate|expand,expand and animate div vertically and horizontally  i m trying to make it so that the divs within my carousel slider will toggle and expand into a larger div that will fit within the carousel on-click and reset with new div contents. all the expanding divs i ve looked at have only slid down  and the old div information remains.    this is the only javascript i ve found  but i do not know how to apply it with new div information upon expanding.   <pre><code>$( #expand ).click(function(){     $( .article-container ).animate({         width:  100px           height:  100px           top:  -50px           left:  -50px           opacity: 0.6      }  1500 ); }); </code></pre>   here is the css for the container before expanding and after.   <pre><code>.article-container{     float: left;     width: 193px;     height: 360px;     margin: 0 13px 0 0; }  .article-container-expand{     float: left;     width: 500px;     height: 1000px;     margin: 0 13px 0 0; } </code></pre>
android|proguard|sony-smartwatch,smartwatch 2: failed to show widget and control when compiling apk with proguard  i created a control extension and two widget extensions for smartwatch 2 with sony add-on sdk v3. if i compiled my apk with progurad  i won t see my app listed in smartwatch 2 s installed applications list. in addition  no my widgets found when editing the clock face.    i am sure that the problem is caused by proguard as the function works well when i compile the apk without using proguard.    i read all sdk documentation and do not find any words about which proguard rules should be added.    i finally find out a solution (may not be the best but it works). please see my answer if you have the same issue.
android|sqlite,sqlitedatabase data change after restoring application from savedinstance  hope your doing fine  i have a problem with my sqlitedatabase  i am holding my database in a service always running in background  and i get it like this :   <pre><code>      public static sqlitedatabase getpostsdatabase(){       if(postsdatabase == null){             if(getanavailablecontext() == null){  return null;  }           postsdbhelper = new postsdbhelper(getanavailablecontext());           postsdatabase = postsdbhelper.getwritabledatabase();       }       return postsdatabase;   }   public static context getanavailablecontext(){       if(mainactivity.mainactivityinstance != null){           return mainactivity.mainactivityinstance;       }else if(getinstance() != null){           return getinstance();       }else{           return lmapplication.getinstance().getapplicationcontext();       }   } </code></pre>   it works fine for first timer  but when the applications is restored from saved instance   and context instances change   my data on the database has changed and are wrong  my question is is the context change really the problem   and if its so   how can i have a presistent context   i tried to use application context for creating it but no improvement !
java|data-binding|model|listener|jface,jface data binding occurs after other events  i want to do something based on the model change  e.g. if user enters text in the text swt widget  i would like to do something based on that. but the problem is  if i use e.g. key listener on the widget  it will get called before the data binding process occurs and therefore the behaviour would nt be consistent. one way around this is to do the logic inside the binding process  but this is not really a convinient way of handling this problem. suggestions     so basically  what i need is an event listener  which is triggered after the data binding occures (on some specified widget of course).
c#|svn|sharpsvn,can t determine the user s config path (when trying to get the revision number)  i am using sharpsvn dll with my visual studio 2010 to get the latest revision number so i can version my project using this number. i tried this piece of code below but it gives me error saying:   <pre><code>can t determine the user s config path </code></pre>   i don t even understand what that means. all i want to do is provide the svn link  my credentials like username and password and get the latest revision number.    here is the code i tried so far:   <pre><code>using(svnclient client = new svnclient()) {     //client.loadconfiguration(path.combine(path.gettemppath()   svn )  true);     collection&lt;svnlogeventargs&gt; list;     client.authentication.defaultcredentials = new networkcredential( john.locke    s7y5543a!! );      svnlogargs la = new svnlogargs();     client.getlog(new uri( https://100.10.20.12/svn/p2713888/trunk/src/ )  la  out list);      string srevisionnumber = string.empty;     int irevisionnumber = 0;     foreach(svnlogeventargs a in list)     {        if (convert.toint32(a.revision) &gt; irevisionnumber)        {            irevisionnumber = convert.toint32(a.revision);        }     }     revisionnumber.text = irevisionnumber.tostring(); } </code></pre>   other ways to get the revision number may also be selected as answer.

jquery|forms|validation|each,jquery  form validation  message after validation of .each field  edit final: omg  i finally found out what goes wrong!! i allmost can t believe  i am testing this piece for 8 hours non stop  and finally...... i am still not sure what and how and why  but it appears that for some reason (i think) i cant have different values for the re-variable  because there are different fields  1 time  its for a text and the other time for a number  for example  if i just define different variables for each possible regex in stead of redefining it  there is no problem! o.o    i have posted the code that i use now in a reply under this post    thanks so much for anyone that have spend some time reading and thinking about this!!    if anyone has ideas on why it went wrong  i am very interested!   <hr>   original question:    cant find the logic why this wont work.. i have a form that i want to validate  each field should be validated onblur: works perfect  on submit it should validate each field: works perfect  when there is some kind of error  it should show a message and return false: does not work.. for some reason  the submit function just does not want to do anything after the .each  it wont even work when i dont do any check on errors  and just want an alert after the .each..    edit: after the mentions of some little errors  it unfortunately still wont work.. here is the total code  inclusive the checkfield-function (the error messages are in dutch  in case you re wondering ;))    edit2: after more testing  it seems its not because of the checkform function  but something to do with the regex test ( if (!re.test(fieldvalue)) ) that gets the code stuck.. cant find the problem though.. any thoughts would be much appreciated!

python|mysql|django,how can i improve performance of soft-deletion in django   i have a moderately large set of models (about 350 000) backed by a mysql innodb table. i m currently using a soft delete method similar to <a href= http://terrarum.net/development/soft-deleting-with-django.html  rel= nofollow >this one</a> that stores a <code>deleted</code> attribute in the database.    i have a view that shows the count of these items  and i have found that filtering the soft-deleted items is very slow.    <code>item.objects.filter(deleted=false).count() -&gt; ~400ms</code>    if i don t exclude the deleted objects  the count is relatively fast.    <code>item.objects.all().count() -&gt; ~140ms</code>    strangely  if i add an index on the <code>deleted</code> column in the db  the time increases.    <code>item.objects.filter(deleted=false).count() -&gt; ~450ms  # indexed on  deleted </code>    what alternatives to this method of soft-deletion might i consider that doesn t make my app 3x slower
c#|unity3d|camera|smoothing,smoothdamp glitch  i have a snake in my scene which is going forward and can swing left and right with smoothdamp. the game camera follows the character from behind  but also responds to right and left movement. however  there is a jitter on the camera and snake seems like it is glitched sometimes.    i had tried <code>fixedupdate</code>  <code>smoothstep</code> and <code>interpolate on rigidbody</code> but none of those worked. <code>lerp</code> is less glitched but not smooth like smoothdamp.    i move the snake with the following function  which is called from update:   <pre><code>vector3 sweetswipe(vector3 pos)  {     // ..........      float midpoint = lasttouch.x;//screen.width / 2f;     float mousepercent = ((input.mouseposition.x - midpoint) / screen.width * 100f);     float targetz = -mousepercent / (10f * screenfix);     targetz += lastposz;      float smoothduration = .10f;     float zv = mathf.smoothdamp(pos.z  targetz  ref mv  smoothduration);      pos = new vector3(pos.x  pos.y  zv);     return pos;       // .......... } </code></pre>   in the update  i arrange the snake and camera position with this function.   <pre><code>void update () {     // ..........     pos = sweetswipe(pos);     head.transform.position = pos;// snake head      vector3 campos = camera.main.transform.position;     campos.x = head.transform.position.x - snakedistance + camstartforward;     campos.y = 6f + ((float)pieces * 0.02f);     campos.z = pos.z * .5f;      camera.main.transform.rotation = quaternion.euler(new vector3(30f + ((float)pieces * 0.01f)  90f  0f));      camera.main.transform.position = campos;     // .......... } </code></pre>   i have tried to use lerp as follows:   <pre><code>float smoothduration = .20f; float zv = mathf.lerp(pos.z  targetz  smoothduration); </code></pre>   the code above worked better  and is less glitched but the movement is unnatural because it is not as smooth as smoothdamp.    does anyone have any ideas for something i can use that is similar to smoothdamp or any solution for the glitch

android|data-binding,activity onsaveinstancestate in the absence of view ids  the default implementation of <a href= https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/activity.html#onsaveinstancestate(android.os.bundle)  rel= nofollow ><code>activity#onsaveinstancestate</code></a> says:   <blockquote>    the default implementation takes care of most of the ui per-instance state for you by calling onsaveinstancestate() on each view in the hierarchy that has an id  </blockquote>   the android data binding guide  and <a href= https://realm.io/news/data-binding-android-boyar-mount/  rel= nofollow >this video</a> - slide 9 suggests that we no longer need view ids when using data binding. my question is: how does the absence of view ids affect state save/restore     arguably  when using data-binding one shouldn t depend on the default mechanism to save/restore state  instead depending on the viewmodel bound to the layout to have the most up-to-date state  but i m still curious to know about the implications.

c#|javascript|node.js|aop|interceptor,coming from aop based authentication in asp.mvc to nodejs  when i am in the .net world and using mvc a common pattern used when wanting to do cross cutting concerns such as logging  authentication  transaction management etc i would use di paired with aop to basically put attributes on my methods which required proxying/weaving.    so it may look like:   <pre><code>public class somecontroller {    [authenticate]    public actionresult someauthenticatedaction() {}     public actionresult notauthenticatedaction() {} } </code></pre>   so given the above when someauthenticatedaction was called it would check the request for an authorization cookie do some logic around that and either bomb the user out with a 401 or something. it would know to do this because it has an attribute on it that at runtime it knows to hook into and proxy.    now i am in javascript land and am looking at getting the same sort of functionality but doing it the best way for that platform. so i am wondering how i should go about doing this in nodejs  as there is no sort of attribute paradigm in javascript so without either ingraining the authentication into each <code>app.* (get post etc)</code> call which i dont like  or at the application entry point proxy each action i know needs to be authenticated  which is not ideal either.    so is there a way for me to indicate that a method <em>should</em> have some cross cutting concern applied to it  without actually putting the logic in there  so that way the web code doesnt know about the authentication mechanism  and the app entry point doesnt know about the specific method  it just knows it wants all methods which have some meta-data with them     i hope this makes sense  as if you dont use aop much you probably will think im talking in riddles  but doing this this way makes my code a lot easier to test and maintain and also allows me to re-configure applications very quickly.    so far i have found <a href= https://github.com/cowboy/javascript-hooker  rel= nofollow >hooker</a>  which can do the proxying part of the puzzle although not quite sure how i would get the underlying request object in it  but i wouldnt see the proxying of an object in js being too much of a pain  but i just need to find a way to identify the methods to intercept... any info would be great.    == edit ==    after reading up a bit more it may look like what i <em>should</em> be doing is using middleware layers to do what i need  as this would at least allow simpler code and the intentions of routes would be clearer. will keep looking at come back once i find out more or a better answer appears.

javascript|jquery|widget|google-closure|google-closure-library,using google closure templates with jquery  we are starting to create an application using javascript and html5 which will use rest api to access server resources taking the advantage of jquery awesomeness and easiness which our dev team is already comfortable with. this application is going to be made multilingual. we had decided later that we will write our dom using javascript which will allow us the flexibility to use our ui bits for integration with our other applications and will create our own widgets using jquery ui widgets. then by just adding a script tag referencing javascript file in a relevant page of our other application  we will have most of our integration for that particular feature done.    because it takes lot of amount of coding for creating dom using javascript  we started looking in search of tools which will help us easily convert html to javascript for creation of ui and hence google closure templates came in.    at this time what i thought of was  using google closure for writing the ui dom bit as it can quickly give me javascript for my dom and then for other javascript (i.e. for server side communication and for other ui logic like changing of ui once got response from the server and x should change to y on click of z kind of things) which needs to be handwritten  i should use jquery which is easy to write.    but after looking at <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/q/1690197/148271 >this question</a>  i see that both are compared against each other and it left me wondering on few things.   <ol> <li> if i go by what i ve thought of doing then  will i be able to call the functions generated by google closure in my jquery widgets to render the ui  </li> <li> if i leave jquery and just use google closure will it be enough for my requirements  </li> <li> as i started reading google closure documentation  i found that it has a whole new world of it s own and learning curve is involved. how much it is  if it is not much  then our team of 5 devs will be ready to learn it. </li> </ol>   on 2 and 3  it would be great if anyone who has already used it can provide some insight.     note:- just in case if it has any relevance  we are working on microsoft .net stack for server side.

php|javascript|time|timezone,client time settings broke readable date in javascript  what i m trying to do is show date in more readable format like 3 seconds ago  1 hours ago  yesterday  june 12 and etc. what i did is   first calculate the timestamp for comment s date.. then send it to client with ajax  then create two date instance on javascript one for is comment s date and other one is current date.. after that i just find differences between to date item then write on the screen with fancy words..  everything works fine on localhost  even server.. but sometimes if client s pc date is earlier from the server date (independent from time zone).. let say server time is today 13.30 pm and client time is today 13.00   it s failing with this scenario because current time is being comment s post time.. difference will be negative value.. i m creating date object for comment in php like this;   <pre><code>date( y-m-d g:i:s ) </code></pre>   then write it to mysql db.. after that when i select comments i convert it to timestamp to push it on client side with ;   <pre><code>$comment[ timestamp ] = strtotime($row[ creationdate ]); </code></pre>   and then in javascript  i make calculation for human readable date format ;   <pre><code>dateobject.getformatted = function(unixtime){  d = new date(unixtime*1000); now = new date();  var diff = (now.gettime()/1000- unixtime) ; var result =   ;  var min = 60      hour = 3600      day = 86400;  if(diff &lt; 2)     result = just now ; else if(diff &lt; min)     result = math.floor(diff) +   seconds ago ; else if(diff &lt; hour)     result = math.floor(diff/60) +   minutes ago ;  else if(diff &lt; day)     result = math.floor(diff/3600) +   hours ago ; else if(diff &lt; day*3) {        var days = diff/day;     if(days &lt; 2)         result =  yesterday ;     else         result = math.floor(days) +   days ago ;  } else if(now.getfullyear() == d.getfullyear()) {     formattedtime = this.gettime(d);     result = this.getsameyear(d) +   at   + formattedtime; } else {     formatteddate = this.getdate(d);      formattedtime = this.gettime(d);     result = formatteddate +   at   + formattedtime; }         return result;     }; </code></pre>   so if clients date is earlier then the comment s date diff value is being negative  so the first case would be true     <pre><code>if(diff &lt; 2) result = just now ; </code></pre>   it s going behing as time difference between client and comment s date .. in my case 10 minutes.. if i set my computer time 10 minutes later it s working nice.. so how can i fix it in a better way     thank you.
android|android-activity|subactivity,main activity grayed-out/disabled on back button  i have a problem on going back (clicking the back button) from sub-activity to main activity: from my main activity i launch a new one (with passing some extras):   <pre><code>intent i = new intent(getapplicationcontext()  searchresults.class); i.putextra(searchresults.results_extra_key  searchresult); i.setflags(intent.flag_activity_new_task); startactivity(i); </code></pre>   in the started activity i am getting data from extras and showing  etc. so everything works very well until i click back button to return back to main activity. then main activity appears but directly after - grays-out. i can t do anything there anymore... this  grayed-out  style looks something like there should be a dialog displayed  but there is no dialog shown  just the whole activity is pushed down/disabled instead...    one another interesting thing i noticed - that activity is still alive in background  because if i click  search  button the quick search box appears on top of my activity and if i click back button then (to cancel it) - it disappears and my activity then becomes fully functional again (gray-out effect simply disappears...)    tried watching <code>logcat</code>  but it shows nothing useful  no exceptions thrown  just this text always comes up:   <pre><code>w/keycharactermap(  564): no keyboard for id 0 w/keycharactermap(  564): using default keymap: /system/usr/keychars/qwerty.kcm.bin </code></pre>   what could cause this problem

android|notifications|android-3.0-honeycomb,does anyone know how to impose counters on status bar notifications in honeycomb  i am trying to use number field of notification class to get  number of events  associated with each notification. for ex. if i have two unread emails  email icon in the status bar should show  2  imposed on the email icon. i think this was working fine with froyo but somehow i am not able to make it work for honeycomb. this is how my code looks like    <pre><code>pendingintent contentintent; remoteviews contentview = new remoteviews(getpackagename()  r.layout.custom_notification_layout); notification.builder builder = new notification.builder(this);  builder.getnotification().number = 2;  builder.setsmallicon(r.drawable.phone_missedcall); builder.setticker( abcd &amp; status : missed call ); notificationintent = new intent (this  notificationsbactivity.class); contentintent = pendingintent.getactivity(this  0  notificationintent  0); builder.setcontentintent(contentintent);  contentview = new remoteviews(getpackagename()  r.layout.custom_notification_layout); contentview.setimageviewresource(r.id.contact_image  r.drawable.ic_contact_picture); contentview.settextviewtext(r.id.line_name   line 2: cisco ); builder.setcontent(contentview); </code></pre>   but it doesn t show  2  imposed over the icon. is there any other way to get the counter in honeycomb     also  tried    <pre><code>int icon = r.drawable.phone_app;        // icon from resources charsequence tickertext =  hello ;              // ticker-text long when = system.currenttimemillis();         // notification time context context = getapplicationcontext();      // application context charsequence contenttitle =  my notification ;  // message title charsequence contenttext =  hello world! ;      // message text  notificationintent = new intent(this  notificationsbactivity.class); contentintent = pendingintent.getactivity(this  0  notificationintent  0);  // the next two lines initialize the notification  using the configurations above notification notification = new notification(icon  tickertext  when); notification.setlatesteventinfo(context  contenttitle  contenttext  contentintent); notification.number = 2; mnotificationmanager.notify(0  notification); </code></pre>   please let me know if anyone has tried notification counters on honeycomb

java|hibernate|jpa,what is the proper gradle setup for jpa static metamodel generator   i m trying to use the jpa static metamodel generator. i found <a href= https://blog.jj-it-services.de/en/jpa-metamodel-gradle/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >a tutorial page</a> that explains how to set it up in gradle. i also found <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/a/36748070/9452 >a stackoverflow comment</a> that says to use the same classpath.  it is:   <pre><code>classpath  gradle.plugin.at.comm_unity.gradle.plugins:jpamodelgen-plugin:1.1.1  </code></pre>   however  when i attempt to use this  i get a gradle build error:   <pre><code>error:could not find gradle.plugin.at.comm_unity.gradle.plugins:jpamodelgen-plugin:1.1.1. searched in the following locations: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/gradle/plugin/at/comm_unity/gradle/plugins/jpamodelgen-plugin/1.1.1/jpamodelgen-plugin-1.1.1.pom https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/gradle/plugin/at/comm_unity/gradle/plugins/jpamodelgen-plugin/1.1.1/jpamodelgen-plugin-1.1.1.jar https://jcenter.bintray.com/gradle/plugin/at/comm_unity/gradle/plugins/jpamodelgen-plugin/1.1.1/jpamodelgen-plugin-1.1.1.pom https://jcenter.bintray.com/gradle/plugin/at/comm_unity/gradle/plugins/jpamodelgen-plugin/1.1.1/jpamodelgen-plugin-1.1.1.jar </code></pre>   what is the problem  is this location out-of-date  if so  what s the new one
javascript|casperjs,download file returned by js get request with unique key  i m new to casperjs.  trying to download a cvs file from my bank.  in a standard browser you would click an  ok  button and then receive the download.  the html for the button is:   <pre><code>&lt;input type= button  id= dialogok  class= ydialogok  onclick= handleyes()  style= width:50px  value= ok &gt; </code></pre>   when that is clicked a function makes the following get request:   <pre><code>https://allmyaccounts.mybank.com/apps/export.obfbank.do actiontype=alltransaction&amp;c=csit_key%3a5l6bkl6bjahy4isx9amg6yzy%2bsg%3d&amp;l=u%3as </code></pre>   the response to that request has the follow properties:   <pre><code>content-disposition: attachment; filename= exportdata.csv  </code></pre>   i don t know how to download that exportdata.csv.  the methods i have found for downloading require you to have the target url.  the problem i see is that the url i need to target requires the csit_key property that is dynamically generated.  once the current session is over the key stops working.  i looked all over the page source and resources but cannot find a reference to csit_key(even by another name) before the button is clicked.  it looks like i have to click that button to initiate the download.     i believe that casper/phantom cannot download a file that it did not specifically request.  let me know if i m wrong on that.  i found the following which i hoped might capture the download if ran right after/before the click but it never fires.  i never see those console.logs.   <pre><code>casper.on( page.resource.received   function(resource) {     if (resource.stage !==  end ) {         console.log( resource.stage !==  end  );         return;     }     if (resource.url.indexof( exportdata.csv ) &gt; -1) {         console.log( downloading csv file );         this.download(resource.url   exportdata.csv );     } }); </code></pre>   my next guess was to try and capture the generated get after the click in order to extract the <code>csit_key</code>.  i could only find how to view response headers  not request headers.    i m hoping someone can set me straight on how to download that csv file.
c#|asynchronous|ui-thread|async-await,custom message pumping with c# async calls  i m creating my own ui handling logic that runs on a single thread. basically  what i m doing is   <pre><code>void handlermain() {     while (true)     {         task[] events = pumpevents();         task.waitall(events);     } } </code></pre>   where one example task that <code>pumpevents()</code> returns is   <pre><code>async task buttonclick() {     var httpclient = new httpclient();     string s = await httpclient.getstringasync( http://microsoft.com );     console.writeline(s); } </code></pre>   the problem of my code is  if one of <code>events</code> takes a long time  it s stuck at <code>task.waitall()</code>  so it can t pump new events making the ui not responsive. is there any other method than <code>waitall()</code> something like   <pre><code>task[] remainingevents = pumpevents(); while (true) {     remainingevents = waituntileverytasksawait(remainingevents);     remainingevents.append(pumpevents()); } </code></pre>   maybe i m on wrong track. i d appreciate your advice!
javascript|node.js|email|promise,promise then and catch in nodejs  i m having a problem with my nodejs server.    what i want is if an email exists in my db  i want to send an email to that address but if not  i want to send and error message to the client.    i have this controller:   <pre><code>reset(req  res) {    return  this.service.getbyemail(req.body.email)       .then(this.mapper.outputemail.bind(this.mapper))       .then(res.json.bind(res)).catch(res.send.bind(res));   } </code></pre>   i send the email in a post method. i use a service that calls my db looking for that email and i have this mapper:   <pre><code> outputemail(outputemail){       return {       email: outputemail.email     };   } </code></pre>   my service:   <pre><code>getbyemail(correo) {     return this.db.find({       where: { email: correo }     });   } </code></pre>   my problem is that i don t know how to control if i get an empty json object.. if i send a post with an email that it doesnt exist i get a <code>{}</code> response  but if i send an exist email i get {email: erwrr@gmail.com}.    what i want is if i get an empty json  i just want to return an error saying that email doesnt exist  but if the query in the db gets a real email i want to continue executing another method that to send an email to that address.
android|google-play|signing,do all apps submitted to the google play store through one developer account need to be signed with the same key   i m sumbitting an android app to google play and am following the process to sign my app.  however the documentation on the android development site seems unclear about whether or not every app i submit through my google play developer account should be signed with the same key or not.      from the <a href= http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html  rel= noreferrer >android developer site</a>:   <blockquote>    android requires that all apps be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed. android uses this certificate to identify the author of an app  and the certificate does not need to be signed by a certificate authority. android apps often use self-signed certificates. the app developer holds the certificate s private key.  </blockquote>

c#|xna|viewport,draw in the target viewport  few days ago  i asked a question about  how to display in a second viewport without redrawing everything .  one of the answers was  you should use a rendertarget2d and give a rectangle source to the spritebatch   this solution is without <code>matrix</code> camera.   <pre><code>spritebatch.draw(     therendertarget2d       theviewporttarget.bounds       therectanglesourcefromtherendertarget2d       color.white); </code></pre>   that works very fine  but i lose a lot of render quality (because of my game zoom and some other things).    the question is : how to draw in the second viewport with <code>camera.transform()</code> to keep the quality  with zoom.    hope you can help.

optimization|opencl|python-idle,opencl idle gpu after i/o  i have a strange problem with an app that is running fine  but has some unreasoned performance lost. the app and code is private  but i can give here some detailed working mode of it (simplified a lot).    my app uses 4 kernels:   <pre><code> 1. preprocesses    reads  i  buffer; writes to  t  buffer   2. process    reads + writes  t  buffer   3. parse &amp; preprocess   reads + writes  t  buffer   &amp; writes  o  buffer   4. check    reads  o  buffer; writes to  c  buffer (result of check) </code></pre>   all the buffers are saved into the device.  i  and  o  buffers are a 200kb buffer each one.  t  buffer is around 20mb and is never used outside the gpu.  c  buffer is just a 4byte int giving the result.    the system runs in 3 different forms:   <pre><code> - pure iterative: write 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 ..... 2 3 read  - iterative + reading intermediate: write 1 2 3 read 2 3 read 2 3 ..... 2 3 read  - iterative + check: write 1 2 3 4 read(c) 2 3 4 read(c) 2 3 ..... 2 3 read </code></pre>   in the first mode all the kernels are queued at once  i have no problem with that mode  just runs at max gpu utilization(and cpu). the other 2 modes use progressive queuing of kernels  if the read value is not correct a new set of kernels is queued.    however in the second and third modes  after each read from device the device remains idle for some time. i have profile the program  and there are small gaps (100us) of no gpu use time after each read. this does not happen after the write part. i have created 2 separate queues for i/o and execution to enable parallelization  with no luck.    the gaps are like this (i could post a screen of visual profiler tomorrow):   <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>write 1 2 3 read 2 <strong>gap</strong> 3 read 2 <strong>gap</strong> 3 ..... 2 3 read</li>   </ul> </blockquote>   this problem appears with hd5770  hd5570  gtx570  c2050  c2070 as far as i have tested. and in windows and linux. <strong>but in quadro 2000m just runs perfectly fine  even doing parallel kernel execution and i/o!!</strong>    is there something i have miss  is pinned memory faster than manual clcreate + clwrite/read  could it solve this problem  i realized that i can run the kernel 2 in that gap as many times as i want but is not possible to run the kernel 3  is the memory  o  somehow protected and blocking the kernel 3 from running      pd: i have some clwaitforevents in the modes that have a gap. i tested removing them and the gap decreased a little around 50%  but cpu usage increased from 20% to 100%. could this had something to do with cpu  or scheduler/driver

java|image|swing|jbutton,exact number of random image(d) buttons in java  i was wondering how can i make a grid of 2x10 with 20 buttons which every button is attached to an image (in java). i must make those buttons by randomly choosing an image  but every button has to appear exact number of times  that means that every button has a random image from a range of images (i ve done that by shuffling the images) and also that button of a specific image can be more than one times.    e.g :   <pre><code>button with im9 must appear 4 times  button with im7 must appear 1 times </code></pre>   is there a way to do that without having to sum all the times of the appearence of every button-image     p.s: i m new to java  please pe polite. i didn t really know how to title my question   i may not have done that right.
python|tkinter,where to put event handlers and pass variables to it   i ve been trying to bind a mouseclick to a grid in a certain frame  after <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33741987/tkinter-bind-mouse-clicks-to-frame/33742699#33742699 >this question</a> i made a new class and bound the event to that  which works. but the function of the mouse event needs a variable that is made in the mainapp class  i can t get it to work properly. depending on the arrangement either i can t get the <code>widgets</code> variable to be used in the function  or the order of functions/classes is wrong and thus the program won t find something because it is referenced too soon.    so my main question is how do i get the function working  which i think mostly involves where do i put that thing  as a function in the <code>schedule_label</code> class  as a function of the <code>mainapp</code>  a loose function  is it smarter to put all the event handlers in a seperate python file and import that     excluding some code this is what is happening:   <pre><code>class schedule_label(tk.label):     def __init__(self  parent  *args  **kwargs):         tk.label.__init__(self  parent  *args  **kwargs)         self.bind( &lt;button-1&gt;   mouse_1)  ... class schedule  this class uses schedule_label  class mainapp(tk.frame):     def __init__(self  parent  *args  **kwargs):         tk.frame.__init__(self  parent  *args  **kwargs)         #class schedule is used here         ...         schedule_widgets = self.schedule.new(date  stafflist)         ...  def mouse_1(event):     r = event.widget.grid_info()[ row ]     c = event.widget.grid_info()[ column ]     schedule_widgets[(r c)].configure(state= active )  if __name__ ==  __main__ :     root = tk.tk()     app = mainapp(root)     app.pack()     root.mainloop() </code></pre>

android|image|gridview|uri|listadapter,making a gridview take images from a specific folder  i am a newbie to android app making and i am still a beginner with a little knowledge . i have been trying to make an android app that works like a gallery   but it only displays images under a specific folder. for the ui   i am starting with only a <code>gridview</code> (or <code>twowaygridview</code> which is derived from the latter)   and have been trying to let this <code>gridview</code> take its contents from this folder .    i have made this folder and copied an image to it for testing and failed. no image was displayed .plus i am not very familiar with <code>cursors</code> and <code>listadapters</code> . somethings that i m sure that are correct are permissions   manifest   and layout of the activity.moreover   i believe my problem is around <code>uri</code>s . please check my code below :    <strong>some namings:</strong>   <pre><code>uri contenturi;  cursor mimagecursor; twowaygridview mimagegrid; listadapter madapter;  string sdcard = environment.getexternalstoragedirectory().getabsolutepath(); </code></pre>   <strong>oncreate method :</strong>   <pre><code>protected void oncreate(bundle savedinstancestate) {         super.oncreate(savedinstancestate);         setcontentview(r.layout.activity_gallery);          file motherdirectory = new file(sdcard+ /favory );         if(!motherdirectory.exists()){             motherdirectory.mkdir();         }           mediascannerconnection.scanfile(this  new string[]{motherdirectory.getabsolutepath()}    null  new mediascannerconnection.onscancompletedlistener() {              @override             public void onscancompleted(string path  uri uri) {                 // todo auto-generated method stub                 contenturi = uri ;                 initgrid(uri);             }         });        } </code></pre>   <strong>initgrid(uri) method :</strong>   <pre><code>private void initgrid(uri folderuri) {    mimagecursor = this.getcontentresolver().query(folderuri          imagethumbnailadapter.image_projection  null  null          mediastore.images.imagecolumns.display_name); mimagegrid = (twowaygridview) findviewbyid(r.id.gridview); madapter = new imagethumbnailadapter(this  mimagecursor); mimagegrid.setadapter(madapter);  mimagegrid.setonitemclicklistener(new onitemclicklistener() {     public void onitemclick(twowayadapterview&lt; &gt; parent  view v  int position  long id) {         log.i(tag   showing image:   + mimagecursor.getstring(imagethumbnailadapter.image_name_column));         uri uri = contenturis.withappendedid(mediastore.images.media.external_content_uri  id);         intent intent = new intent(intent.action_view  uri);         startactivity(intent);     } }); } </code></pre>   thanks for your help   and please if there is an easier alternative way of doing this tell me  i care for the results more than the methods now . if you need anything or any more information please tell me in the comments below . thanks again !

java|arraylist|thread-safety|wait|notify,java threads: wait notify mechanism with arraylist  i tried implementing wait/notify mechanism to modify the <code>arraylist</code> using two separate threads.     it seems to work fine for first iteration but then for second iteration it waits forever in <code>addtoarray()</code> method. i am not able to figure out why is it waiting forever in the method  as per my understanding the other thread (removing an item) should pick up when other thread goes to wait.     please have a look and point out possible bug if any. i know i can use <code>vector</code> to have thread-safe operation but that is not what i want.    <pre><code>package threadtest; import java.util.*;  public class dhagajava {      public static void main(string...strings){         arraymodification am = new arraymodification();          thread t1 = new thread(new addtoarray(am));         thread t2 = new thread(new removefromarray(am));         t1.start();         t2.start();     } }  class arraymodification{     boolean added = false;     arraylist&lt;integer&gt; al;      arraymodification(){         al = new arraylist&lt;integer&gt;();     }      public synchronized void addtoarraylist(int x) {         if (added == true){             try {                 wait();             } catch (interruptedexception e) {                 e.printstacktrace();             }         }         this.al.add(x);         system.out.println(al);         system.out.println( added!! :) );         added = true;         notifyall();     }      public synchronized void removefromlist(){         if( added== false){             try {                 wait();             } catch (interruptedexception e) {                 e.printstacktrace();             }         }         system.out.println(al);              this.al.remove(0);         system.out.println( removed!! :   );         added = false;         notifyall();     } }  class addtoarray implements runnable{      arraymodification ma;      addtoarray(arraymodification m){         this.ma = m;     }      public void run() {          for (int i = 0; i&lt;10; i++)             ma.addtoarraylist(i);     } }  class removefromarray implements runnable{      arraymodification ma;      removefromarray(arraymodification a){         this.ma = a;     }      public void run(){             ma.removefromlist();     } }  class removefromarray implements runnable{        arraymodification ma;        removefromarray(arraymodification a){             this.ma = a;       }        public void run(){             //for(int j=11;j&lt;20; j++)                   ma.removefromlist();       } } </code></pre>   output is:   <pre><code>[0] added!! :) [0] removed!! :   [1] added!! :) </code></pre>

android|kotlin,kotlin aar library w/ proguard: how to keep extension methods   i m writing a new kotlin library module to add commonly used classes and extension methods.  i m compiling each extensions file (eg bitmapextensions.kt) into a single file called  extensions  using <code>jvmmultifileclass</code>:   <pre><code>@file:jvmname( extensions ) @file:jvmmultifileclass  fun bitmap.crop(croprect: rect) = ... </code></pre>   as a part of our company s ip policy i need to obfuscate the library via proguard <em>before</em> it makes it to any consumer project.  i therefore need a proguard rule to keep these extension methods so that they are not thrown away.      at first glance the below seems to work  inspecting the generated aar s classes.jar shows that the extension methods still exist and their internals have been obfusecated.  but when actually compiling in a consumer project  i get unresolved references to any extension method i ve referenced.   <pre><code>-keepclassmembernames class mycompany.kotlin.util.extensions {     &lt;methods&gt;; } </code></pre>   when i disable minification  the project builds correctly.    how can i obfuscate my library and keep my kotlin extensions     edit: it appears that using <code>keep</code> on the entire package  and even specifying <code>-dontshrink</code> is not enough.  the methods simply cannot be referenced in the consumer app.      edit2: i believe i have narrowed this down to the <code>.kotlin_module</code> file under /meta-inf/ being removed when <code>minifyenabled=true</code>.  this appears to be the only difference between my minified and non-minified classes.jar.  something is removing this file... or preventing its generation.

java,passing * in as command line argument in simple java calculator  so  the question is basic. in the code below  when i pass command line argument as <code>java commandlinedemo 3 5 *</code> the file names in my current directory are being listed. doing some research in google i found out we should supply <code>*</code> as <code> * </code> in command line.     my question is  how can my code be modified so that it accepts <code> * </code> in command line and performs product of <code>operand1</code> and <code>operand2</code>   <pre><code>class commandlinedemo {     public static void main(string[] args) {         int operand1 = integer.parseint(args[0]);         int operand2 = integer.parseint(args[1]);         char theoperator = args[2].charat(0);         system.out.print(args[0] + args[2] + args[1] +   =  );         switch(theoperator) {             case ( + ):                 system.out.println(operand1 + operand2); break;             case ( - ):                 system.out.println(operand1 - operand2); break;             case ( * ):                 system.out.println(operand1 * operand2); break;             case ( / ):                 system.out.println(operand1 / operand2); break;             default:                 system.out.println( invalid operator selected );         }     } } </code></pre>

python|itertools,making python itertools work on multiple conditions  i am trying to learn python itertools (love it so far!)  but i am struck with a problem. i have the following two lists:   <pre><code>a=[ http://www.xyz.com/jhuh7287    http://www.hjuk.com/kashjh716    http://www.psudjg.com/9279jshkoh    http://www.xyz.com/jhuh7287     http://www.xyz.com/9289jhjbg ] data=[ k   some small string here    so med string here    some string here   l ] tempstring= http://www.xyz.com  </code></pre>   initially  what i wanted was to remove data[i] for all strings which are below a certain length  and subsequently delete the corresponding entries in a. for this  i used something along the lines of:   <pre><code>iselectors = [x is not len(str(x))&gt;1 for x in data] data=list(itertools.compress(data  iselectors)) a=list(itertools.compress(a  selectors)) </code></pre>   ..which works well. now  i need to add another condition to my iselectors  which states that only when  tempstring is in a[i]  and len(str(x))>1..    so  i have tried something like:   <pre><code>iselectors = [tempstring in a and x is not len(str(x))&gt;1 for x in data] </code></pre>   ...but i am not sure this is right  since i do not think i am iterating over the entire a when i use  tempstring in a     any guidance would be much appreciated. thanks.

javascript|html|knockout.js,including knockout.js or html from javascript function call  i m trying to learn more about javascript and i ve been checking out some code from companies like olark which includes a messaging system on your site.    one thing that i noticed is that when you install their software on your server is that it s just a simple copy/paste of some javascript and then you have a styled window on whatever page it s installed. this has to mean that some html/css is returned  right     my question is  how can you go about using javascript and having a form returned or referenced  such as knockout.js  for example  in the most simple sense  say i have the following html page. can i use a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to call to my server which will return a form    <pre><code>//page1.html &lt;body&gt;     ...some html here     &lt;script&gt; function call which will return a knockout.js form/table/whatever along with referencing the file containing the viewmodel&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>   from what i understand anything in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is not affected by the same origin policy. does this mean i can potentially use javascript to call for an external knockout.js form
java|for-loop|nested-loops,draw a fence in java using for loops  i am tasked to make a fence drawing program.  so far i can have the user input values to set height and width and using nested for loops i can get it to output the height and width as a  #  symbol.  the problem is i need it to have a border of # with | in the middle.     currently a 4 height 4 width fence looks like this   <pre><code>####      #### #### #### </code></pre>   i need it to look like this   <pre><code>#### #||# #||# ####      public void draw() {        for (i = 1; i &lt; height-1; i++) {            system.out.print( # );            for (j = 1; j &lt; width-1; j++) {                system.out.print( | );            }            system.out.println( # );        }        fencecount++;    } </code></pre>   when is it ok to use a break.  i have a loop asking if the user would like to build another fence type y or n.  at the end for the terminating user input  n  does anyone know if there is a better way to do this than a break;   and is a single break  ok  here   i have heard breaks are sloppy in loops.  also i always feel like i have to reverse my thinking on while loops.
php|mysql|performance,php mysql slow query access  i have a table in my database :    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/zkkrv.png  alt= enter image description here >    and i m using mysql to insert/update/create info however the time it takes to execute queries is slow example:    first when a user runs my app it verifies they can use it by retrieving all ips from the db with    <pre class= lang-sql prettyprint-override ><code>select ip from user_info </code></pre>   then using a while loop if the ip is in the db do another query:   <pre class= lang-php prettyprint-override ><code> select valid from user_info where ip=  .$_server[ remote_addr ].     </code></pre>   if valid is 1 then they can use it otherwise they can t however if their ip is not found in the db it creates a new entry for them using   <pre class= lang-php prettyprint-override ><code> insert into user_info (ip first) values (  .$_server[ remote_addr ].     .date( y/m/d ) .  ) )  </code></pre>   now this first script has finished it accesses another - this one was supposed to update the db every minute however i don t think i can accomplish that now ; the update query is this:   <pre class= lang-php prettyprint-override ><code> update user_info set name=  .$name.    status=  .$status.    last=  .$last.    address=  .$address.   where ip=  .$_server[ remote_addr ].   )  </code></pre>   all together it takes average <strong>2.2 seconds and there s only 1 row in the table atm</strong>    my question is how do i speed up mysql queries  i ve read about indexes and how they can help improve performance but i do not fully understand how to use them. any light shed on this topic would help.    nubcake
python|performance|pandas,frequency of letters in column python - speed optimization  i want to calculate the frequency that each element (a character) occurs at each position  in a similar manner to a <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/q/21103320/1274242 >previous question</a>. this is my current solution:   <pre><code>import pandas as pd sequences = [ aatc                 gcct                 atca                 tgag                 cgga ] f = zip(*sequences) counts = [{letter: column.count(letter) for letter in column} for column in f] counts=pd.dataframe(counts).transpose() print counts    0  1  2  3 a  2  1  1  2 c  1  1  2  1 g  1  2  1  1 t  1  1  1  1 </code></pre>   (pandas is there because it is my preferred output). however  since i am dealing with hundreds of thousand  and potentially millions of sequences (10 characters or more in length)  this is somewhat slow: it takes 20 minutes for ~100^3 sequences  and several hours in my real dataset. so i thought i could improve the speed by resorting to pandas since i am converting anyway to dataframe anyway: <code>df = pd.dataframe(f).transpose()</code>.     this strategy turns out to be even slower:    <em>solution 1</em>   <pre><code>import time  start_time = time.time() counts = [{letter: column.count(letter) for letter in column} for column in f] counts=pd.dataframe(counts).transpose() print(counts) print( --- %s seconds ---  % (time.time() - start_time)) --- 0.00820517539978 seconds --- </code></pre>   <em>solution 2</em>   <pre><code>start_time = time.time() df = pd.dataframe(f).transpose() print df.apply(lambda col: col.value_counts()) print( --- %s seconds ---  % (time.time() - start_time)) --- 0.0104739665985 seconds --- </code></pre>   so the question is: is there a way to optimize this  i looked into multiprocessing for <code>df.apply(lambda col: col.value_counts())</code> but there seems easy to be no easy implementation.

android|eclipse,android eclipse onclicklistener working with onitemselectedlistener  i want to validate if the spinner equal  something  then it will toast a text  please pick a value  .the validation triggers whenever we click the button.    the problem is i don t know how to implement it properly.however i made a code to do that and the toast text will appear when we do nothing when the app launched the toast text just appear without click on the button. and other validations works perfectly it will appear after we click(checking if edittext empty)    edit:i m making a pmt function app where there are an edittext for price input  another for percentage of the price.and then there are some spinner for picking if the thing you re buying(in my app its for counting the price for cars) is new or used  zone you re living(in my country there are 3 zones mid east west)and the insurance(combine comprehensive tlo).those all will then be calculated when the button clicked  but to avoid bug i want to have a validation which will triggered by the same button.and this where i got stuck  my code is bad in structure  i mean my implementation is bad    i want to do something like this one:   <pre><code>string item1 item2;

java|swing|user-interface|jtable|imageicon,why won t my jtable let me insert an imageicon   pretty simple  i tried following some other questions here on how to modify the jtable to take an imageicon. i have an image in my package called successicon.png.    this is the code for my jtable  mostly auto-generated by net beans:    <pre><code>statustable = new javax.swing.jtable();  statustable.setmodel(new javax.swing.table.defaulttablemodel( new object [][] {  }  new string [] {      icons    message  } ) { class[] types = new class [] {     javax.swing.imageicon.class  java.lang.string.class }; boolean[] canedit = new boolean [] {     false  false };  public class getcolumnclass(int columnindex) {     return types [columnindex]; }  public boolean iscelleditable(int rowindex  int columnindex) {     return canedit [columnindex]; } }); </code></pre>   one of my buttons uses a static command from another .java file:   <pre><code>  dbcommands.executecommand(sqlarea.getselectedtext()  (defaulttablemodel) statustable.getmodel()  selectarea); </code></pre>   this is the method signature for the method it calls. this command is called fine  i m including it just in case:    <pre><code>public static void executecommand(string command  defaulttablemodel model            jtextarea selectarea){ </code></pre>   that command passes it into a method called printstatus which is supposed to update the jtable  but it isn t working. at first under icon it would print  successicon.png   but with my current code it doesn t put anything there at all:    <pre><code>public static void printstatus(string message  string command  printwriter statfilewriter  defaulttablemodel model){      object[] row = new object[2]; // so i can add row to table      imageicon icon = new imageicon( successicon.png );       row[0] = icon;     row[1] = message +   (  + command +  )  +  \n ;     model.addrow(row);    } </code></pre>

c#|sql-server|transactionscope,does transactionscope support atomic db execution   i am at the moment developping a project where the dal is implemented in .net using the ado entity framework.    the db structure is not straightforward and i would like to be able to ensure that some db operations are atomic.    i know that you can do that by creating a <code>stored procedure</code> and using a db <code>transaction</code> (as mentioned in <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/259803/t-sql-stored-procedure-execution-atomic >this so post</a>). (i m using sql server)    the thing is  i would like to keep the logic on the software side as much as possible  and i was considering using .net <code>transactionscope</code>. although i understand that it works well from a software point of view (nothing is committed to the db until the whole scope is committed)  i doubt it still ensures db atomic execution.    does somebody know about this     more specifically  usually the code would look like this:   <pre><code>using (transactionscope scope = new transactionscope()) {   /*    * do some opreations such as reads  write  insert  deletes    */    scope.commit() } </code></pre>   what i d like to make sure  is that everything within the brackets is done  atomically  (isolation=serializable i guess). what i mean by that is that i don t want the state of the db to be able to change when the code within the scope is executing.

java,copy stack to array  this is a version of the algorithm i have:   <pre><code>public void copystacktoarray(stack&lt;integer&gt; stack) {     int i = 0;     while (!this.bestroutestack.empty()) {         this.array[i++] = stack.pop();     } } </code></pre>   (the bounds on the array are guaranteed to be okay here for my code)    i m wondering if there is a library algorithm that does this  but a search turned up nothing.
java|android|parse.com|uuid|pubnub,android - pubnub - pass the uuid or username of a user with each sent message  hello<br>i ve built an android application that uses pubnub to create a chat channel between each user. i would like to be able to identify which users have sent which messages. currently the login of my app is handled by parse so each user has a unique username. i found some documentation and example code where rather than sending just the message string  an object was set up that contained the uuid and message string as two different objects that could then be extracted on the subscribe side but from what i could tell this was only in the pubnub javascript code not the java code for android.<br><br>right now i m thinking that the only way for me to do this is to attach the uuid/username to the beginning of my message string with a special character to seperate the uuid and the message and then split it up and read it in on the subscribe side.<br> for example <code>string message =  uuidhere_messagehere ;</code>. <br>is this the correct way to approach this or is there a better  more convenient way of doing this <br>thanks

python|numpy|grid|polygon|utm,python determine the mean and extract maximum value inside a polygon over a grid in an array  i have 3 numpy arrays which consist of utm-x(256) and  utm-y(256) coordinates  and the accumulated rainfall(65536) for a weather radar 256x256 (km) in utm.    i also have a polygon inside the grid bounds that is a catchment boundary in utm.     i need to determine the average rainfall over just the catchment polygon (a clipped sub set of the radar data)  and the maximum  and the location of the maximum. i have already determined the average over the entire radar grid.     so the question is: how do i perform analysis on a subset of a numpy array that is determined by the polygon  i would have thought that this would be a very common operation  but have not found any python scripts to perform this operation.    here is an illustration of the data set:    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/pbvrr.png  alt= image of radar grid and white dashed catchment polygon in utm note red stars are rain gauge locations >
javascript|android|html5|canvas,using samsung s-pen in canvas  i am working on a web application where the user should be abled to sign a document on a tablet. we use the galaxy tab 12.2 because the s-pen has the desired precision.  the canvas where i draw on uses listens to the <code>touch</code> events to draw on the canvas.   <pre><code>        canvas.addeventlistener( touchstart   handlestart);         canvas.addeventlistener( touchmove    handlemove); </code></pre>   the problem here is  that if the user touches the canvas with his fingers  the canvas will draw lines there.    is there a way to differentiate between s-pen events and  normal  touch events     i know that on the surface pro 3 with internet expoler i can handle pen input different from finger input.
java|swing|jpanel|jlabel|boxlayout,java swing component interaction (boxlayout and label)  ok  several questions about the test code below...  i don t have the full working program to post  but i m hoping people know swing well enough to take a stab at it.  this is a jlabel inside of a jpanel(boxlayout)  and i m working on the sizing of the label in the lower right.    what i get with the code as shown is a status box 300 width by 30 height.  i have fiddled with the preferred size and the label minimum size  and it does not seem to behave in any rational way.   <ol> <li>why does the jpanel preferred size affect the height but not the width   if i change the x dimension in setpreferredsize() to 0 or 500  it still comes out 300 from the label.</li> <li>why does the jlabel minimum size affect the width but not the height   if i comment the setpreferredsize() call and increase the label height to 30  nothing happens.</li> <li>i started out with jpanel setminimumsize (commented)  but it no longer has any effect - why does the jpanel require setpreferredsize() </li> <li>if i change the label text from    to      this increases the height of the label.  since the label is not controlling the height here  why does this have any effect at all </li> </ol>   by the way  the createrigidarea() call is to force the separator to the right  rather than sticking to the left hand side of the screen.  if there are any less kludgy ideas for this  i d be grateful.   <pre><code>    private jcomponent makestatusbartest() {     jpanel statuspanel = new jpanel();     statuspanel.setlayout(new boxlayout(statuspanel  boxlayout.line_axis));     statuspanel.setcomponentorientation(componentorientation.right_to_left); //  statuspanel.setminimumsize(new dimension(0  30));     statuspanel.setpreferredsize(new dimension(500  30));     jlabel statuslabel = new jlabel();     border emptyborder = borderfactory.createemptyborder(5  10  5  10);     statuslabel.setborder(emptyborder);     statuslabel.settext(  );     statuslabel.setminimumsize(new dimension(300  20));     statuspanel.add(statuslabel);     statuspanel.add(new jseparator(swingconstants.vertical));     statuspanel.add(box.createrigidarea(new dimension(5000 0)));      return statuspanel; } </code></pre>

java|inheritance|multiple-inheritance,multiple inheritance and java  multiple inheritance is not supported in java (as of yet  but will likely stay this way).    but  what about the <code>object</code> class  say you have an object <code>a</code> that inherits from the <code>object</code> class. now  you create a class <code>b</code> that inherits from the <code>a</code> class. but  with every class inheriting the <code>object</code> class  isn t <code>b</code> exhibiting multiple inheritance by both inheriting from <code>object</code> and <code>a</code>     is it that java <em>knows</em> it will always have objects inheriting from the <code>object</code> class and therefore can support it easily  otherwise  if everyone was inheriting from multiple classes all willy-nilly  oracle would have to have to implement a lot more support.    or  is it that rather than inheriting from both <code>object</code> and <code>a</code>  <code>b</code> is inheriting only from <code>a</code> which <em>contains</em> the inheritance from <code>object</code> all wrapped in one object

jquery|animation,slighty move around/float grouped elements on hover – jquery animation  i already searched the web for a plugin or tutorial to achieve a subtile animation effect  without any success so far :(    i m going to have a world map with differently sized icons on it. these icons will be arranged in cloud like groups  i think i ll just float the items of one group within a fixed container.     to make it more organic i d like to add a hover effect  so that the items of one group react on mouseover  slightly moving or floating around as if they were swimming in a bowl and the mouse slightly moves the water around.    could this be done just with jquery animate()  i m not sure if it would end in a smooth and  organic  animation  affecting the whole group when they re just positioned via css floats.    maybe anybody did something like this before or could point me to an example     i would really appreciate any help! thank u.

java|file|compression|huffman-code|lzw,compressing large files using blocks in java  i am compressing files of over 2gb in java using a consecutive application of two compression algorithms; one lz based and one huffman-based. (this is similar to deflate).    since 2gb is too large to be held in any buffer  i have to pass the file through one algorithm outputting a temporary file  then pass that temporary file through the second algorithm  outputting the final file.    an alternative is to compress the file in 8mb blocks (the size where i don t get an out-of-memory error) but then i have an inability to take full advantage of the redundancy within the entire file.    any ideas how to perform these operations neater. no temporary files  and no compressing in blocks  do any other compression tools compress in blocks  how do they deal with this issue  regards

c#|windows|oracle|named-pipes|sql-loader,oracle sql loader from windows named pipe (unable to open file)  i am attempting to use windows named pipes to stream data using an oracle 11.2 sql loader executable so that i do not have to write from memory to and from the disk.  i can write the data to the named pipe and consume it from a different client  so the pipes seem to be working.    after creating the named pipe server stream with name  \.\pipe\name  and invoking the sql loader with: ... data= \.\pipe\name   i receive the following error:   <pre><code>sql*loader-500: unable to open file (\\.\pipe\name) sql*loader-554: error opening file sql*loader-509: system error: the operation completed successfully. </code></pre>   i am using c# to create the named pipe:   <pre><code>const string pipefile = @ \\.\pipe\name ; namedpipeserverstream pipestream = new namedpipeserverstream(pipefile); </code></pre>   i have pre-created the pipe  pre-populated it partially  tried many variants of pipe names (with extensions  different folders  etc) -- so far nothing has worked.  always the same error.    does anyone know how to hook it up so that named pipes are properly consumed via oracle sql loader

php|arrays|search|mysqli|foreach,searching a database for and input aswell as array values in one search php  mysql  ajax  i am having an issue where i can not search for the exact data i want. i can search the database fine and return all the values in the format i want. however i want to add in the ability to search by a company s name and also display those results in the same table. the companys names are not stored in the databse but are in the array  session pulled from an api. we store the id for each company in the database which is set as the keys from the array.    i want to know if there is any way to get results given form the array as well as the database search. i know i can do it with a foreach loop around all my sql select statement  but the issue with that is if there is no match in the array it will not run any search  making the rest of the search very limited as searching by ip address is one of the main reasons for this. the only way i think it is possible is adding a foreach loop into the sql statement but i don t see how that is possible nor can i find any documentation on it online. please help!     here is my code that runs based on an input from a search box sent by ajax.       <pre><code>// start sessions  connected to db set customer array  session_start(); $conn = connect(); $customers = $_session[ array ];  // if ajax posted search input if($_post){     $search = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn  $_post[ search ]);      //set a second input for checking against customers array and format to give results     $input = $search     $input = strtolower($input);     $input =   $input  ;     $result = preg_grep($input  $customers);     $arrayk = array_keys($result);  //select search mysql query $matchingcompanies =   ;   foreach($arrayk as $id) { $matchingcompanies .=     . $id .    or  ; } $matchingcompanies = substr($matchingcompanies 0 strlen($matchingcompanies)-4);  $query1 =  select * from ipv4_linked where `companyid` = (  . $matchingcompanies .  ) or concat(ipv4address  ipv4subnet  hostname  owner  sitename) like  %  . $search .  %  ;       $view4 = mysqli_query($conn  $query1);     //table title row     echo  &lt;div&gt;&lt;table name = ipv4  class= tableparent &gt;&lt;td class= tabled &gt;ip address&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= table &gt;subnet&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= table &gt;pc name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= table &gt;owner&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= table &gt;customer&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= table &gt;customer site&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; ;  //loops through search results and echo table     while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($view4)){          $id = $row[ companyid ];         $company = $customers[$id];          echo  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class= tabled &gt; . $row[ ipv4address ]. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= table &gt; . $row[ ipv4subnet ]. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= table &gt; .$row[ hostname ]. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= table &gt; . $row[ owner ]. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= table &gt; .$company. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= table &gt; .$row[ sitename ]. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; ;     }         echo &lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt; ; }   &gt; </code></pre>

c#|.net|linq,dynamically chose a field in a table to update  how can you write an update statement to update a table in a database with the field being different for each update  and using linq to sql. having searched stackoverflow and google i find everything related to dynamic select statements  which i am not needing.    some information to help:    i have a table named persons with typical fields: firstname  lastname  phone  address  city  state  etc.    i currently do separate functions to perform an update to firstname  next one to lastname  etc. i would like to combine these into 1 function that can update the given field to the given value and i am using linq to sql.    let me know if this is still clear as mud.    mud clearing up per comments: to clarify i am using linq to sql.    code information:   <pre><code>bool updatepersonfirstname(string firstname  int personid) {     bool _wasupdated = false;      if (personid == 0)           throw new arguementmissingexception();      using (customermodeldatacontext proxy = new customermodeldatacontext())     {        try         {             var _result = proxy.persons.singleordefault(_per =&gt; _per.personid = personid)             _result.firstname = firstname;              proxy.submitchanges();              _isupdated = true;          }          catch (exception ex)          {              throw ex;           }      }      return _isupdated; }  bool updatepersonaddress(string addressinfo  int personid) {     bool _wasupdated = false;      if (personid == 0)           throw new arguementmissingexception();      using (customermodeldatacontext proxy = new customermodeldatacontext())     {        try         {             var _result = proxy.persons.singleordefault(_per =&gt; _per.personid = personid)             _result.address = addressinfo;             proxy.submitchanges();               _isupdated = true;          }          catch (exception ex)          {              throw ex;           }      }      return _isupdated; } </code></pre>   repeating the above for each updatable field in the persons table.    i would like to accomplish the following:   <pre><code>void updatepersontable(string fieldname  string fieldvalue  int personid) {   ...   var _result = proxy.persons.singleordefault(_per =&gt; _per.personid = personid);   _result.[field matching fieldname] = fieldvalue;   proxy.submitchanges();   ...    } </code></pre>   to recap  i would like 1 method that will do the update based on passing in the field name and value vice having to make multiple update statements.    <strong>edit:</strong> code updated to provide more of the functions methods. proxy is just a name for the model data context  as mentioned previously this is using linq to sql connections.

javascript|angularjs,replace old value with new value before render angularjs  i have input box which is taking input from user. now i have to add some validation stuff. like if user enter value which is less than min value then entered value should replace with last entered value. for example    min value = 10; if user entered 15 and then 8. so 8 should replace with 15. but i want replace it before 8 render on the page.    i have written the code but it is not working as expected. it is not working when you want replace 10 to any two digit number. i know the issue but dont know the how to fix it.   <pre><code>app.directive( exampledirective1   function() {     return {         restrict:  e           template: &lt;input type= text  ng-model= message.msg &gt;           link: function(scope  elm  attrs) {        var copy = angular.copy(scope.message.msg); scope.$watch(function (){return attrs.min}  function (newvalue  oldvalue) {        newvalue = json.parse(newvalue);        oldvalue = json.parse(oldvalue);   console.log(copy)  console.log(parseint(newvalue.msg) == copy)            if(parseint(newvalue.msg) &lt; parseint(copy)){            console.log( df )                scope.message.msg = oldvalue.msg      }                 //console.log( oldvalue=  + oldvalue);                 //console.log( newvalue=  + newvalue);                 //do something             });           //  console.log(message);                                }     }; }); </code></pre>   <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/rmduw/656/  rel= nofollow >fiddle</a>

android|jni|native|reverse-engineering|shared,native shared library (.so) on android looks encrypted - how to get it   i m reverse-engineering an android app. problem is  i don t have much experience with android internals  all my rev-eng skills being related to x86 practice. the apk of the app comes with two native libraries inside (lib...so)  the more interesting one of the two is encrypted (no elf header  no gcc signatures etc). hoping it will be decrypted when the app is in use  i installed it on a rooted tablet only to find that <code>/data/app-lib/com.[appname]/lib[something].so</code> is also encrypted (.so file is identical to that inside the apk) there  even when the app is being actively used! i surmise there has to be some sort of transparent decryption when this native library is being loaded by the app.    is it some kind of built-in feature of jni  if not  how that could have been achieved  and how to catch the app in the middle of loading this library  since i uderstand the ld-linux must see a normal elf-style library anyway else it fails.

android|android-linearlayout|relativelayout,aligning a linear layout within a relativelayout to the center and to the left  currently i have tried aligning my linear layout to the left and center but currently cannot get this to work. see code below:   <pre><code>    customlinearlayout sidemenu = new customlinearlayout(this);      relativelayout.layoutparams sidemenuparams = new relativelayout.layoutparams(layoutparams.fill_parent   layoutparams.wrap_content);     sidemenuparams.addrule(relativelayout.center_vertical);     sidemenuparams.addrule(relativelayout.align_parent_left);         sidemenu.setlayoutparams(sidemenuparams);        sidemenu.setorientation(linearlayout.vertical);     sidemenu.setlayoutparams(new layoutparams(layoutparams.wrap_content  layoutparams.wrap_content));     sidemenu.setbackgroundcolor(color.transparent);     //sidemenu.setgravity(gravity.center);      sidemenu.addview(appsoups);     sidemenu.addview(salads);     sidemenu.addview(ribs);     sidemenu.addview(favorites);     sidemenu.addview(sandwiches);     sidemenu.addview(sides);     sidemenu.addview(desserts);      relativelayout screenlayout = new relativelayout(this);     screenlayout.setlayoutparams(new layoutparams(layoutparams.fill_parent  layoutparams.wrap_content));      screenlayout.setbackgroundresource(r.drawable.body_bkgd);     screenlayout.addview(sidemenu);      setcontentview(screenlayout); </code></pre>   customlinearlayout is just a class that extends linearlayout to do some custom drawing. anyway what i am doing wrong here  so far it aligns left and to the top of the relative layout but i cannot get it to center. just as a side note both or either or of my rules do not work in conjuction with setting the linearlayout to the center(i have it commented out in the code). finally the views that i am adding to the linear layout are just textviews - just fyi(code not shown)

javascript,javascript how to quickly get total count of reports in employee array  i need to determine the total count of reports a manager has to specify the size of a square in a d3 treemap visualization. the data is a csv file with 209000 records and is formatted with these column headings: employee  employeeid  and managerid.      the number i have to find includes direct and indirect reports--both people that have a manager id equal to the manager s employeeid and people who report to that lower level manager  and all reports down the corporate ladder.    <pre><code>var i  thelength  j  thejlength  k  theklength; var runningcount = 0; function getreportcount(csvall  employeeid  employee) {   var csvallmodified = csvall.filter(function(d) {       return (d.managerid == employeeid);   });   runningcount+= csvallmodified.length;     i=0     thelength = csvallmodified.length;     for(; i &lt; thelength; i++){ // loop through one level reports         //get reports two level below         csvallmodified2 = csvall.filter(function(d) {           return (d.managerid == csvallmodified[i].employeeid);         });              //managerids.push(csvallmodified[i].employeeid);         runningcount += csvallmodified2.length;         j=0;         thejlength = csvallmodified2.length;         for(; j &lt; thejlength; j++ ){             //get reports three levels below             csvallmodified3 = csvall.filter(function(d) {               return (d.managerid == csvallmodified2[j].employeeid);             });             runningcount += csvallmodified3.length;             k=0;             theklength = csvallmodified3.length;             for(; k &lt; theklength; k++) {                 //console.log( employee name 3 levels below:   +         csvallmodified3[k].employee);                  csvallmodified4 = csvall.filter(function(d) {                   return (d.managerid == csvallmodified3[k].employeeid);                 });                 runningcount += csvallmodified4.length;             }         }     }   return runningcount } </code></pre>   <strong>my question is</strong>: how can i structure the code above so that it runs way more efficiently  at present it is taking a couple of minutes to run. and i have to add a couple more management layers to get the final total count.

c#|regex|quotes,regex (c#): match > < & (illegal xml chars) but only when contained within qutoes  i need to do a replacement on the escaped xml chars <code>&gt;</code> <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code>  but only when they are contained within single quotes. this is important because the regex pattern shouldn t be able to find the <code>&gt;</code> and<code>&lt;</code> when they are the beginning and ending tags.     example  given the string <code>&lt;element&gt;&lt;element value=  hello&amp;stack&lt;overflow&gt;  /&gt;&lt;/element&gt;</code>    i should only get the <code>&gt;</code> <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code> that are within the single quotes <code> </code>. this is so i can replace them with the proper <code>&amp;amp;</code> <code>&amp;lt;</code> and <code>&amp;gt;</code> (long story it s the result of a muddled xml parsing that happened).    i know i can use <code> (.*) </code> to get all characters in between the single quotes  but now how can i extract only the escaped characters within that.

jquery|jquery-animate,assign index of deleted product  i have a simple jquery script that allows user to add products to basket and see the animation. <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/z6ave/7/  rel= nofollow >http://jsfiddle.net/z6ave/7/</a>    now  i have a slight problem and just can t seem to find a plausible solution.    as you can see in the code  when you add a product to basket  the order attribute gets assigned:   <pre><code>product that was added 1st - order 1 product that was added 2nd - order 2 product that was added 3rd - order 3 product that was added 4th - order 4 product that was added 5th - order 5 product that was added 6th - order 6 </code></pre>   and so on... and that s fine  every position has a certain css rule attached to it.    but  if i delete some product in the middle or any other that isn t the last one  and when i add another one after that  i need it to fill the empty place.    what happens right now is this... if i delete product number 3 from the list above  and add another one after that  the list will look like this:   <pre><code>product that was added 1st - order 1 product that was added 2nd - order 2 product that was added 4th - order 4 product that was added 5th - order 5 product that was added 6th - order 6 product that was added 7th - order 7 </code></pre>   you see that the problem is the empty space of number 3  so the 7 should actually go under 3.    can you help me with this one  i know there must be some easy/elegant solution.    thank you

android|jenkins|gradle|android-gradle,ignore gradle build failure and continue build script   managing android s dependencies with gradle is done in a weird way. they have to be downloaded differently into a local repo. this is a pain when setting up ci build as there are multiple nodes this could run on. as such i m using the <a href= https://github.com/jakewharton/sdk-manager-plugin  rel= nofollow >sdk-manager-plugin</a> to have the android dependencies downloaded at build time. there seems to be <a href= https://github.com/jakewharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/10  rel= nofollow >an old bug</a> that i m experiencing with the sdk-manager-plugin though in that it will download the dependencies at build time  but they won t be available on that command.    the next time the command is run everything works fine (as everything is already downloaded)  but i need to find a way to ignore the build failure of the first gradle command so that everything is downloaded and good to go for the second. i realize this is hacky  but i m done messing with this.    ideally something like this would work:   <pre><code>./gradlew clean --ignorebuildfailures ./gradlew distributecibuild </code></pre>   the closest thing i could find in the gradle documentation is --quite but that doesn t look like it d work.    any creative solutions welcome.
java|osgi,is there a way to find out which bundles are using my bundle   i m a building an osgi framework and i was wondering if there is a way to get all the bundles who bound themselves to mine     it s because i offer a service to those bundles  and make new resources to optimize my preformence while offering this service. i also offer a way to destroy those resources when no longer needed  but i want a failsafe for when a bundle unbinds without first deleting his used resources.     can i use my bundlecontext for this
php|session|authentication|nginx,how does session/authentication work with nginx/nhpm/php-fpm   so  i m looking at architecting an application using nginx with the nginx-http-push-module and php-fpm  and after lots of fun configuring  i got it working to the point of handling php pages as it should.    what i don t get  though  is how sessions are supposed to work - all of the examples i ve seen for nginx+nhpm run through the publisher-subscriber system  but it s never clear what should happen if the subscriber channel is going to be  effectively  unique to a subscriber. think of a chat system with a public channel and a private channel for each user  for example.    now  in a conventional php setup  you d be passing the cookies to php  looking up the session from there  and handling the rest of the page based on whether the user was authenticated or not  but with php-fpm and long-polling  it doesn t seem like it should work like that.    i can understand if the request is a non authenticated user  you just dump them with an error message and terminate the long-poll from the client knowing that it s not valid  but with a valid request  you almost need to poll from the client  authenticate in php  then disconnect but leaving the request open - and i m not sure how that part works.    can anyone explain how it should be achieved  ideally with an example if possible  please note i m <em>not</em> looking for http basic authentication here  i need the authentication to be looked up against a separate data storage which is in mongodb.

java|android,how to prevent gcmtaskservice periodictask from running again if previous hasn t finished   i have set up a periodictask that runs every 60 seconds or so. it should only take a second or 2 to run  so it s very unlikely that any overlap would occur  but should the previous run hang or something  what would be the best way for me to detect this and skip the current run     also  would there be a way to kill the previous run from the new run  or would i have to wait until the 3 minute timer runs out     thanks!

c#|asp.net|visual-studio,how to add a c# application for desktop and a asp.net application for web in the same solution  i d like to have a solution with multiple projects to deploy on my webserver. i have several web handler projects  but on the other hand i have a desktop application that  when deployed  will constantly run in the background of my system. i noticed that visual studio .net express for web does not allow user s to create desktop applications (visual studio express for desktop is required for such programs). i d like to have everything as part of the same solution so that all the applications can connect with the same database.     is there any way i can have both projects in my web application  or alternatively is there some way to create an application in visual studio 2012 .net for web that can be run on the server and just do it s thing in the background while the server handles web requests

python|python-2.7|inheritance,python: subclass of a class instance   this is mostly a program design question.    i have multiple identical instrument housings each of which contains four identical instruments that i can communicate with remotely. i want to make an instrument housing class that contains: methods to communicate with each housing  methods to do housing-specific operations  and the housing attributes (addresses) necessary to use those methods with them.    i additionally would like to make  subclasses for the instruments themselves. these subclasses would have methods to do instrument-specific operations that call the superclass  methods and attributes to communicate through the housing.    the problem with this design is that each housing would ultimately have five instances: one for its operations and one for each of its four instruments.    is it possible to create an instance of the housing class and then have subclasses inherit from the housing instance  or am i thinking about this design in the wrong way (i m relatively new to python)

php|mysql|sql|table|cascade,multiple fields cascade mysql  i have a problem:    i have a table  likes  which is structured as this:   <pre><code> -- likeid  -- elementid  -- elementtype </code></pre>   the rest of the table is not important. let me explain the table: likeid is just the id of the inserted like. elementid is the id of the element being liked. elementid is not unique  because elements can have different elementtypes and therefore ther is the field elementtype.    so let s say this:    i like element 1 of elementtype 0. it would be <code>(likeid  elementid  elementtype) values (1 1 0)</code> now as a mysql insert. now i like element 1 of elementtype 1. now it would be<code>(likeid  elementid  elementtype) values (1 1 1)</code>    now i have two extra tables: the table for elementtype 0 and the table for elementtype 1. they are structured similarly like this:   <pre><code> -- thiselementid  -- blabla other fields not important </code></pre>   and    <pre><code> -- otherelementid  -- blabla other fields not important </code></pre>   what i want now is a <code>on delete cascade</code>. when i delete element 1 of elementtype 0 which is part of the thiselementid-table  it should also delete the like for it. but the problem is  that element 1 of elementtype 1 has the same id value (otherelementid).    how can i manage this to work  i hope you understand what i mean! :)

android|webview,android webview long press not on link i.e in white space  i can detect a long click on my webview using the following code:   <pre><code>webview.setonlongclicklistener(new onlongclicklistener() {         @override         public boolean onlongclick(view v) {             log.d( debug   on long press web view );             return false;         }     }); </code></pre>   this works fine when i long press on a link  but doesnt work when i long press in an area where no link is  i.e whitespace.    my first thought to address this was to use the gesturedetector:   <pre><code>public boolean dispatchtouchevent(motionevent event) {                   super.dispatchtouchevent(event);     return detector.ontouchevent(event); } </code></pre>   or   <pre><code>public ontouchlistener otl = new ontouchlistener() {     @override     public boolean ontouch(view v  motionevent event) {         if (detector.ontouchevent(event)){             return true;         }else{             return false;         }     } }; </code></pre>   and then overide the onlongpress method of the gesturedetector:   <pre><code>public void onlongpress(motionevent e) {  } </code></pre>   either of the above methods above work and the onlongpress method is executed when i long click on the web page but not on a link. the problem is when i now long click on a link both long press methods are called  firstly the gesturedetector onlongpress and secondlythe webview onlongclick. is there a way to just invoke only the webview onlongclick() when i long click on a link.    andy

android,android: make app transparent and act on the background application  is it feasible to make our android application completely transparent (as if its not active at all) and work on the other apps      my requirement:    first last an app and after some few settings  make it transparent. once its transparent  the user will not know that this app is active  however  our app should respond to only specific controls.     this is because of the broadcast receiver limitation  i will have to use the volume button for some actions in my application. but  this button doesn t broadcast. so  currently i am using power button which is not the requirement.     please throw some light on this. i did some research but  couldnt find any. :(

jquery|html,jquery how can i make this code use .children()   ok. as you can see.  i have some inefficient code.     the point of it is to check the children of a parent element.    i couldn t figure out how to use .children()  so i wrote some longhanded code keying on 2 fields (the id and class). i d rather just use the class but i couldn t figure out how to use just the  level  class by itself.    but i don t want to depend on the id  just the class. (plus i d rather use .children() if anyone know how)    extra points for making the jquery shorter  as i don t think i need the if statements either.   <pre><code>    &lt;div class= jobtypeheadlghtred inputfields  id= jobtypename &gt;                               &lt;input type= checkbox  class= checkbox level1  checked=  checked   id= isselected_j_l1 &gt;             &lt;div class= sectionheadertext  id= jobtype &gt;level 1 item&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class= facilityheadlghtblue inputfields  id= jobtypename &gt;                               &lt;input type= checkbox  class= checkbox level2  checked=  checked   id= isselected_j_l2 &gt;               &lt;div class= sectionheadertext  id= jobtype &gt;level 2 item&lt;/div&gt;                          &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class= headlghtgreen inputfields  id= jobtypename &gt;                               &lt;input type= checkbox  class= checkbox level3  checked=  checked   id= isselected_j_l3 &gt;               &lt;div class= sectionheadertext  id= jobtype &gt;level 3 item&lt;/div&gt;                          &lt;/div&gt;  $(function() {     $( :checkbox ).change(function() {          var id = this.id;         var level = id.substring(id.length - 1);          if(level == 1){             $( [class*= level2 ]  [class*= level3 ] ).attr( checked   this.checked);          }          if(level == 2){             $( [class*= level3 ] ).attr( checked   this.checked);          }   }); }); </code></pre>

jquery|ajax|fadein,fade in multiple images in secquence once they have loaded  what i am trying to achieve is a grid of images (10x10) that firstly load after the rest of the page has finished loading  and secondly fade in 1 after another    i.e. (represents only one line)   <pre><code>---------- +--------- ++-------- +++------- ++++------ </code></pre>   etc... what i have so far is this:   <pre><code>&lt;script type= text/javascript &gt; var loadingimage = false; function loadimage(imagename imagefile) {   if ((!document.images) || loadingimage) return;   loadingimage = true;   if (document.images[imagename].src.indexof(imagefile)&lt;0)   {     document.images[imagename].src = imagefile;   }   loadingimage = false; } loadimage( 0   images/0.jpg ); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   with this image tag   <pre><code>&lt;img class= fade  name= 0  onload= loadimage( 1   images/1.jpg )  /&gt; </code></pre>   this gives me half the solution in as much as it loads all the images in sequentially  but i cant seem to add a fade to these images. the images are set up in an ul with 10 pictures in each li  and 10 li s in total = 100 images.    how can i fade these in  also is there a way to print out all the images in a loop insted of having them manually written in  so the user doesnt have to go through and make sure every image tag is correctly named  (ive already got a batch image renamer)    i found <strong><a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1746141/multiple-fadein-animations-in-jquery >this</a></strong> which is similar to what i need  but i couldnt work out how to get it to load the way i want. thanks
python|sql|postgresql|python-2.7|psycopg2,use python and psycopg2 to execute a sql file that contains a drop database statement  i am trying to use a python function to execute a .sql file.      the sql file begins with a <code>drop database</code> statement.<br> the first lines of the .sql file look like this:   <pre><code>drop database if exists mydb;  create database mydb; </code></pre>   the rest of the .sql file defines all the tables and views for  mydb     <strong>python code:</strong>   <pre><code>def connect():     conn = psycopg2.connect(dbname= template1   user= user01 )     conn.set_isolation_level(psycopg2.extensions.isolation_level_autocommit)     cursor = conn.cursor()      sqlfile = open( /path/to/mydb-schema.sql    r )     cursor.execute(sqlfile.read())      db = psycopg2.connect(dbname= mydb   user= user01 )     cursor = db.cursor()     return db cursor </code></pre>   when i run the <code>connect()</code> function  i get an error on the <code>drop database</code> statement.    <strong>error:</strong>   <pre><code>psycopg2.internalerror: drop database cannot be executed from a function or multi-command string </code></pre>   i spent a lot of time googling this error  and i can t find a solution.    i also tried adding an autocommit statement to the top of the .sql file  but it didn t change anything.   <pre><code>set autocommit to on; </code></pre>   i am aware that postgresql doesn t allow you to drop a database that you are currently connected to  but i didn t think that was the problem here because i begin the connect() function by connecting to the template1 database  and from that connection create the cursor object which opens the .sql file.    has anyone else run into this error  is there any way to to execute the .sql file using a python function

java|opencv|image-processing,categorizing images with opencv java  i have images of blank sky and few images of mars.i have built an application in java where one of the features requires me to categorize these images based on whether they are of mars or of blank sky.i m very new to opencv and tried to compare histograms by taking two images of blank sky.the correlation value should ve been near 1 since both images are of the blank sky but the value is near 0.i need to know what changes to make or if there are other methods to solve this problem.this is the code that i tried.<a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/rmuda.jpg  rel= nofollow noreferrer >this is the first image</a> and <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/zncf0.jpg  rel= nofollow noreferrer >this is the second image</a>   <pre><code> public static void compare()  {      string pathtosamplepic = null  pathtopic= null filenamein;       file samplepic = null  pic = null;      samplepic=new file( c:\\images\\image2.png );       pic=new file( c:\\images\\image1.png );       pathtosamplepic=samplepic.tostring();      pathtopic=pic.tostring();      mat h1 = histogram(pathtosamplepic);      mat h2 = histogram(pathtopic);       double text = imgproc.comparehist(h1  h2 imgproc.cv_comp_correl);       system.out.println( text is +text);      if(text&gt;0.5)          system.out.println( both images are same );      else          system.out.println( images are different );  }  public static mat histogram(string filenamein)   {      mat img = highgui.imread(filenamein);        mat src = new mat(img.height()  img.width()  cvtype.cv_8uc2);      imgproc.cvtcolor(img  src  imgproc.color_bgr2gray);       vector&lt;mat&gt; bgr_planes = new vector&lt;mat&gt;();                                                                                                                                                                                       core.split(src  bgr_planes);      matofint histsize = new matofint(256);      final matoffloat histrange = new matoffloat(0f  256f);      boolean accumulate = false;      mat b_hist = new  mat();      imgproc.calchist(bgr_planes  new matofint(0) new mat()  b_hist  histsize  histrange  accumulate);      return b_hist;  } </code></pre>   ignore the part where i am doing if(text>0.5). that was just to check if it s working.

java|email|gmail,using java mail pop3 cannot seem to delete emails from gmail  i have a java program that acts as a pop3 client using javax.mail.  i am able to list and retrieve the contents of a gmail inbox no problem.  however  i cannot seem to delete emails.  here is the (important parts of the) code:   <pre><code>pop3store sto=... another method creates and connects the pop3store folder ibx=sto.getfolder( inbox ); ibx.open(folder.read_write);  message[] msgarr=ibx.getmessages();  for(int mi=0; mi&lt;msgarr.length; mi++) {     ...do stuff with the message     msgarr[mi].setflag(flags.flag.deleted  true);     } ibx.close(true); //folder.close(true) indicates to expunge the folder sto.close(); </code></pre>   after running this and seeing it handle each message  i go into gmail and the emails are still there  and even showing as unread.  if i re-run the java client  it will see and handle the same emails.    this same code happily deletes emails from an exchange server.    how can i get gmail to delete emails

javascript|google-chrome|google-chrome-extension|listener|background-process,background script being re-run for each page navigated to  i ve written a google chrome extension called  <a href= https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/word-welter/ahmpgoebcklpogmobamdjliigbncofep hl=en-gb  rel= nofollow >word welter</a>  which demonstrates typoglycemia.    this extension uses a background script to toggle the word scrambling on and off. however  whilst this works on a web page  if a user turns the functionality on and then browses to a different page (i.e. clicks on a hyperlink in the current page)  the chrome button goes back to it s initial state (although the button s tooltip text say the functionality is still on!) and the scrambling functionality is off. it looks as though my content script is only executed once (i.e. when the toggle is executed).    i want the scrambling functionality to remain active as a user navigates to other pages and i d hoped my use of the background script would work but it clearly isn t. anyone know how i can fix this issue     note that the scrambling feature worked fine (i.e. for every page a user would navigate to) before i introduced the toggle button. however the toggle button is need as it gets annoying if every page is constantly scrambled!    the background script (background.js) is as follows:   <pre><code>var toggle = false; chrome.browseraction.onclicked.addlistener(function(tab) {   toggle = !toggle;   if(toggle){     chrome.browseraction.seticon({path:  wordweltericon19x19_on.png   tabid:tab.id});     chrome.browseraction.settitle({title:  word welter on });     chrome.tabs.executescript(tab.id  {file: content_script.js });   }   else{     chrome.browseraction.seticon({path:  wordweltericon19x19_off.png   tabid:tab.id});     chrome.browseraction.settitle({title:  word welter off });     chrome.tabs.executescript(tab.id  {code: window.location.reload(); });   } }); </code></pre>   and my manifest.json has the following entry for the background script:   <pre><code> background : {     scripts : [ background.js ]    } </code></pre>   any help is appreciated.

php|mysql|database|hyperlink,php link with sql database  new to php here. i m working on a basic php project for university. i have a page with a list of patients. when you click on the patient it will take you to the patient page with more details of that patient.    i have a main patientdetails.php page which will display the details.    however i am a little puzzled. how do i get the   name..  part of the link to work. so how do i get the patientdetails page to load the specific patient details     i have an index.php page which has the list of patients as below.   <pre><code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href= patientdetails.php name=stuart &gt;stuart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href= patientdetails.php name=fred &gt;fred&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; </code></pre>   in the patientdetails page i have a select statement to gather details from the database but not sure where else to go from here.   <pre><code>   $query = sprintf( select * from phpenrolment where patid =  $patid  and name     =  $name  and email =  $email  );  $result = mysql_query($query  $link);     if ($result) {   while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {    } </code></pre>   as you can see above the database table with patients has the patid  name and email field.    thanks    please note: this is a basic project that i am working on  so i am aware some of the features are outdated but i need to get it working with these features if possible.
javascript|angularjs|google-visualization|linechart|google-chartwrapper,google charts linechart options not totally working (dual y-axis)  i ve built several charts in d3 but at the clients request i started using google charts. so far  i like it a lot  but i can t get the options to work correctly.    i m using <a href= https://github.com/angular-google-chart/angular-google-chart  rel= nofollow >angular-google-chart</a> and i double checked that the options are getting passed to the google api correctly  and they are. i also read the <a href= https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart  rel= nofollow >line chart docs</a> thoroughly  so i m pretty confident the syntax is correct  but let me know if you see any issues with the data below.    there are several options that are not working  but in particular  none of the vaxis options are working; the most important of which is the y-axis titles are not showing.    i ve noticed that the linechart api is a bit finicky. for instance  i made the overall chart title bigger and it just randomly stopped showing the top legend  so i had to change it back. i wish there was some sort of document that outlines the tradeoffs to each option change.     note that i m trying to show two y-axes.   <pre><code>$scope.chartobject = {         type:  linechart

c#|visual-studio|visual-studio-2015,visual studio propertie autocode  i am using microsoft visual studio community 2015 and when i define a private variable and i use the tool  quick actions and refactors...  (right clicking on the variable) i get the next auto-code:   <pre><code>private list&lt;test&gt; tests;  public list&lt;test&gt; tests {     get     {        return tests;     }      set     {         tests = value;     } } </code></pre>   i do not like this long branches  i would prefer something like:   <pre><code>public list&lt;test&gt; tests {     get { return tests; }     set { tests = value; } } </code></pre>   there is a way of change this behavior     edit:    what i am asking is not the same than the question linked (when marked as duplicated). i was wondering if once the variable is <strong>already</strong> created i can generate a propertie in the form i want  not to generate a new variable.

android|debugging|memory-management,android running out of memory  below i am showing the first and second activities. the first one is just to show what the baseline memory is. my question is: <strong>what is going on in the second activity that is allocating so much memory !</strong>     it should not be working so hard and i can t figure out what it is that is allocating so much memory at that steady pace. it continues to allocate at the rate shown below for the second screen until it runs out. then i guess the gc gets called and re-allocates memory. then the memory keeps getting allocated until it runs out again and again.    <strong>first activity screen:</strong>    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/pqpbb.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/pqpbb.png  alt= first screen ></a>    <strong>first activities memory:</strong>    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/vcbcv.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/vcbcv.png  alt= memory for first screen ></a>    <strong>second activity screen:</strong> no buttons have been pressed yet and nothing is being recorded. signalstrengthlistener checks for changes in the lte parameters and updates the ui once per second. but the memory is going out of control.    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/fk88v.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/fk88v.png  alt= second screen ></a>    <strong>second activity memory:</strong>    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/4kwov.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/4kwov.png  alt= memory for second screen ></a>    here is my code for the second activity and its layout:    <strong>second.java</strong>   <pre><code>public class second extends activity implements runnable {      public static signalstrengthlistener signalstrengthlistener;

javascript|google-chrome|console.log|object-create,object.create alters console output of proto object in chrome   i was playing around today when i noticed that some of my objects in chrome s console were being displayed as <code>object</code> instead of the constructor function name.    this was odd  so i boiled it down to the following code:   <pre><code>function baz() {     this.baz = true; } var b = new baz(); var c = object.create(b); console.log(b); // why is b outputting with object not baz  </code></pre>   in the above code <code>b</code>  is not created via a <code>object.create</code> and yet when logged it says object. <strong>i don t have a typo there  and mistakenly asking about c.</strong> the log of b has been altered when i haven t even touched that object. creating another instance <code>c</code>  should not alter <code>b</code>.    this has to be a chrome bug right  is there anyway to get chrome to correctly report <code>baz</code> here     this is important for debugging purposes.     <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/pobcz.png  alt= enter image description here >    <strong>update</strong> bug filed: <a href= https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail id=478522  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail id=478522</a>
multithreading|java-ee|jboss|wildfly,wildfly: receiving shutdown event to prevent early shutdown of managedexecutorservice  i m using managedexecutorservice in my app  specifically with quartz. its watcher threads are run within the executor service.    at app shutdown i stop quartz in a @predestroy method and it should finish its watcher threads - that s what how it s meant to be and how it have been until i switched to managed executor.    the problem now is that when i shutdown the server  managedexecutorservice shuts down before @predestroy gets called.    is there a way i can get a notification of a shutdown event  can i declare some kind of dependency on  managedexecutors subsystem  so that it gets cleaned up when  cdi subsystem  is finished

android|json|google-http-client,how to parse data in json farmet using google http client (android app)   i am getting data from server by building a get request (httprequest). the data is not in json format (when i open the link in a web browser  it says  this xml file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. the document tree is shown below. )    since it is the case  when i call this line:   <pre><code>httprequest request = buildgetrequest( treelocation ); final locationlistresponse response = request.execute().parseas(getresulttype()); </code></pre>   the app stops there  and i think it is because it does not regconize the resulttype.    so  now i want to declare the content type as json. anyone knows how to declare the content type in google http client library

java|javascript|javascript-events,call a java class directly from javascript without <applet> or <object>  i ve had <em>some</em> experience with java and javascript and searching this forum has helped me tremendously  but haven t been able to find this exact problem explicitly.  in a nutshell:  i want to call a java class straight from javascript i.e. use a java class in javascript without object or applet.     here s what what i m experimenting with:   <pre><code>function screensize() { alert( screen dimension\n  +    width:       + java.awt.toolkit.getdefaulttoolkit().getscreensize().width      +   height:  + java.awt.toolkit.getdefaulttoolkit().getscreensize().height); } </code></pre>   which is an example given on <a href= http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0170.html  rel= nofollow >http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0170.html</a>.  this is hooked to a button on a page.  when clicking the button i (in essence) get:   <blockquote>    a runtime error has occured at line 35:  java  is undefined.  </blockquote>   i m assuming that my path is incorrect or missing and there s a path or classpath or something i ve overlooked.    i d eventually like to move the javascript into a bookmarklet so that the user will be able to click a favorite on the appropriate page and have <strong>magic</strong> happen because of my own java classes manipulating the data from the screen.  for various reasons political and technical  i m stuck using ie6-7 and have to work with scraping the web page in the browser and processing it on the client -- no sever side action for me!  i can assume that a jre 6 will be available.     is it a path issue   is what i want even possible and if so  how   and how will packages work with all this      thanks.  any advice or examples will be muchly appreciated.

c#|.net|asynchronous|task-parallel-library,the difference between task.factory.fromasync and beginx/endx   i have very similar code when using the standard beginread and endread methods from the tcpclient and using task.factory.fromasync.    here are some examples.. error handling code not shown.    <strong>task.factory.fromasync:</strong>   <pre><code>private void read(state state) {     task&lt;int&gt; read = task&lt;int&gt;.factory.fromasync(state.stream.beginread  state.stream.endread  state.bytes  state.bytesread  state.bytes.length - state.bytesread  state  taskcreationoptions.attachedtoparent);      read.continuewith(finishread); }  private void finishread(task&lt;int&gt; read) {     state state = (state)read.asyncstate;      state.bytesread += read.result; } </code></pre>   <strong>standard use of callbacks with beginread and endread:</strong>   <pre><code>private void read(state state) {     client.beginread(state.bytes  state.bytesread  state.bytes.length - state.bytes.read  finishread  state); }  private void finishread(iasyncresult async) {     state state = (state)async.asyncstate;      state.bytesread += state.stream.endread(async); } </code></pre>   both of these work fine but i am curious of their differences. the lines of code for both are pretty much equivalent and they both seem to perform the exact same function and have the same efficiency. which one is preferable  what would you rather see in production code

javascript|html5|drag-and-drop,how to keep child elements from interfering with html5 dragover and drop events   i have a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> drop target that i have attached  drop  and  dragover  events to. the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> contains an image inside an anchor tag (simplistically: <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>). the child elements of the target seem to block the  drop  or  dragover  events from being triggered. only when the dragged element is over the target  but not over its child elements  are both events triggered as expected.    the behavior i would like to achieve is that the  dragover  and  drop  events are triggered anywhere over the target <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>  regardless of the existence of child elements.
bluetooth-lowenergy|android-6.0-marshmallow|pairing,android 6  authentification issue with ble device  access to the linkkey bits  i ve got an issue about android 6 and ble compatibility.    my app initiate a read request on a protected characteristic which launch the pairing display to enter the appropriate passcode. with the right pass code  the smartphone and the ble device are bonded just fine if it s with android &lt; 6.0    i tried with an android 6.0.1 too but it keeps giving me the same message  couldn t pair because of an incorrect pin or passkey     it s not a permission issue since i already get the position permission with access_coarse_location request.    it seems it s a problem about the linkkey bits in the pairing request. i need to access it and block it since the ble device is confused by the additional bit(s) in the pairing request (because of its use of the bluetooth 4.0 and not 4.2).    any idea how to do that

python|django|django-rest-framework,django rest framework - posting to writable nested field containing a foreign key value  new to drf and so far it s been very useful  as is the documentation..however i m trying to wrap my head around how this should work. i m basically trying to  on <code>post</code>  create a new <code>reputation</code> object that has a foreignkey related field <code>mentionid</code>. <code>mentionid</code> already exists.     the reputation object is represented correctly  and looks like:   <pre><code>{      id : 5       author : 1       authorname :  name        value : 100       mentionid : {          id : 1           author : 1           somekey :  some value      }  } </code></pre>   but when i post i receive this error:    <code>the `.create()` method does not support writable nestedfields by default. write an explicit `.create()` method for serializer `quickstart.serializers.reputationserializer`  or set `read_only=true` on nested serializer fields.</code>    i m assuming i need to define a create method in the serializer  but out of curiosity i noticed if i comment out the line referencing the <code>mentionserializer</code> i can successfully post the <code>mentionid</code> field  but it returns an object with just the <code>mentionid</code> foreign key value  which is not what i want. so i m curious if i m missing a parameter in my model that would solve my issue. maybe i need to set a  default value on the foreign key in my model  thanks for any insight.   <pre><code>{      id : 5       author : 1       authorname :  name        value : 100       mentionid : 1  } </code></pre>   my model has a reputation class:   <pre><code>class reputation(models.model):     mentionid = models.foreignkey(mention) </code></pre>   i have a serializer:   <pre><code>class reputationserializer(serializers.modelserializer):     mentionid = mentionserializer()     class meta:         model = reputation         fields = ( id    author     authorname    value    mentionid )   </code></pre>

java|linux|eclipse|sqlite|runtime-error,sqlite java.lang.unsatisfiedlinkerror in linux  i have a program that uses sqlite database. it works fine on windows (exported jar or directly in eclipse) but when i move it to linux server (plan is to use run it at certain intervals  cron job). i m exporting it to jar from eclipse and packing the sqlite-jdbc4-3.8.2-snapshot.jar with it. error is this:   <pre><code>/$ /usr/bin/java -jar /home/username/software.jar /home/username/ java.lang.unsatisfiedlinkerror: /tmp/sqlite-3.8.2-amd64-libsqlitejdbc.so: /tmp/sqlite-3.8.2-amd64-libsqlitejdbc.so: failed to map segment from shared object: operation not permitted exception in thread  main  java.lang.unsatisfiedlinkerror: org.sqlite.core.nativedb._open(ljava/lang/string;i)v     at org.sqlite.core.nativedb._open(native method)     at org.sqlite.core.db.open(db.java:161)     at org.sqlite.core.coreconnection.open(coreconnection.java:145)     at org.sqlite.core.coreconnection.&lt;init&gt;(coreconnection.java:66)     at org.sqlite.jdbc3.jdbc3connection.&lt;init&gt;(jdbc3connection.java:21)     at org.sqlite.jdbc4.jdbc4connection.&lt;init&gt;(jdbc4connection.java:23)     at org.sqlite.sqliteconnection.&lt;init&gt;(sqliteconnection.java:44)     at org.sqlite.jdbc.createconnection(jdbc.java:113)     at org.sqlite.jdbc.connect(jdbc.java:87)     at java.sql.drivermanager.getconnection(drivermanager.java:582)     at java.sql.drivermanager.getconnection(drivermanager.java:207)     .... </code></pre>   so before you ask  i ve made sure that sqlite-3.8.2-amd64-libsqlitejdbc.so in /tmp/ has all permissions (rwxrwxrwx). still that native library is causing problems. it does get copied in /tmp/ folder though. that being said i totally suck in linux... and for that reason i m pretty much clueless what to try next.    what should i do  switch connector     edit: solved the problem by using system.setproperty( java.io.tmpdir    /home/username/ ); apparently it for some reason couldn t execute the native library from tmp folder... probably because it was created by root. also i had to revert back to sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar because the new one crashes on linux.

php|session,securing session id  i have built my first login system.  the user enters a username and password and they are given a session id with their username and id.    this username and id is then used to customize the pages they see.    every users username and id are basically public information  but the session id is only made by the system when they login.    <strong>question:</strong>    what are the security risks of using session id here where the contents are basically public but to get the session id you have to login     can someone fake the session id from the public id and username of someone else since that is all a session id contains here  is this easy to do     are their any common things to make it safer
c#|asp.net-mvc|asynchronous|async-await,multiple await operations or just one  i ve seen how the <code>await</code> keyword is implemented and resulting structure it creates. i think i have a rudimentary understanding of it. however  is   <pre><code>public async task dowork() {     await this.operation1async();     await this.operation2async();     await this.operation3async(); } </code></pre>    better  (generally speaking) or   <pre><code>public async task dowork() {     await this.operation1async();     this.operation2();     this.operation3(); } </code></pre>   the problem with the first approach is that it is creating a new <code>task</code> for each await call  which entails a new thread     whereas the first creates a new <code>task</code> on the first <code>await</code> and then everything from there is processed in the new <code>task</code>     <strong>edit</strong> ok maybe i wasn t too clear  but if for example we have   <pre><code>while (await reader.readasync()) {     //... }  await reader.nextresultasync();  // ... </code></pre>   is this not creating two tasks  one in the main thread with the first <code>readasync</code> then another task in this newly created task with the <code>nextresultasync</code>. my question is there really a need for the second task  isn t  the one task created in the main thread sufficient  so   <pre><code>while (await reader.readasync()) {     //... }  reader.nextresult();  // ... </code></pre>
php|mysql|tags,best performance for tags in mysql/php  i have one table with items and one table with tags that can be linked to the items. should i create a table where i store the relations between them or can i store the tag ids right in the item table like a column with  1 52 375  (tag ids).    i would in most cases lean towards a relation table  but i will mostly add one single tag per item and at the most 10 so i wonder if it s worth it.    if going with the relation table will i need a  loop-in-loop  where i make one query per item to fetch the tags. it seems like a lot of queries or is there a different solution     i could also fetch all the items and tags separately in two queries and link them with php. also loop in loop  but less database queries.    what do you think  thanks!
python|xpath|css-selectors|scrapy,duplicate results in xpath and not css selectors in scrapy  so i am playing around with scrapy through the <a href= https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html  rel= nofollow >tutorial</a>. i am trying to scrape the text  author and tags of each quote in the <a href= http://quotes.toscrape.com/page/1/  rel= nofollow >companion website</a> when using css selectors like mentioned there:   <pre><code>for quote in response.css( div.quote ):     print quote.css( span.text::text ).extract()     print quote.css( span small::text ).extract()     print quote.css( div.tags a.tag::text ).extract() </code></pre>   i get the desired result (i.e: print of each text  author and quotes once). but once using xpath selectors like this:   <pre><code>for quote in response.xpath( //*[@class= quote ] ):     print quote.xpath( //*[@class= text ]/text() ).extract()     print quote.xpath( //*[@class= author ]/text() ).extract()     print quote.xpath( //*[@class= tag ]/text() ).extract() </code></pre>   i get duplicates results!     i still can t find why there is such a difference between the 2.
php|forms|validation|zend-framework|zend-framework2,zend 2 form validators  i have some validators set up in a zend 2 form  but isvalid always returns true  ignoring them. dumping the whole form object  it doesn t look like the validators are even attached  here s the form code:   <pre><code>namespace usermanagement\form; use zend\form\form;  class searchuserform extends form {     public function __construct($name = null)     {         // we want to ignore the name passed         parent::__construct( searchuser );         $this-&gt;setattribute( method    post );         $this-&gt;add(array(              name  =&gt;  search                attributes  =&gt; array(                  type   =&gt;  text                    required  =&gt; true              )               filters   =&gt; array(                 array( name  =&gt;  striptags )                  array( name  =&gt;  stringtrim )              )               validators  =&gt; array(                 array(                      name     =&gt;  stringlength                        options  =&gt; array(                          encoding  =&gt;  utf-8                            min       =&gt; 4                           max       =&gt; 100                      )                  )             )          )); </code></pre>   then in the controller i check if it s valid:   <pre><code>        if( $this-&gt;getrequest()-&gt;ispost() )         {              $searchform-&gt;setdata( $this-&gt;params()-&gt;frompost() );             if( $searchform-&gt;isvalid() )             {                 echo  yep ;exit;             }             else             {                 echo  nope ;exit;             } </code></pre>   always outputs  yep  despite a 1 character string length. i have actually got this working but placing the validators in a separate filter class and attaching it to the form instead - but my question is <em>should</em> this work

java|arrays|arraylist|poker,dealing cards in java with an arraylist  essentially what the method specifications entail is thus: remove the specified number of cards from the top of the deck and return them as an array. for example  if the parameter is 4  then the first four cards in the deck will be returned as an array of size 4. now  i have constructed the method for the most part  but i keep getting an error  and from my understanding is has to do with the passed parameter <code>numcards</code>. i m having a fair bit of difficulty detecting the bug. any suggestions  another note  i m using arrays in this method  but as you can see <code>cards</code> is of an arraylist type. this.cards.toarray(small); is assigning the content of <code>cards</code> to the array small. the cards will be removed from the front of the  cards  arraylist  not the back.   <pre><code>public card[] deal(int numcards) {         card[] dealt = new card[numcards];            for (int i = 0; i &lt; numcards; i++) {            dealt[i] = cards.get(i);            }           card[] small = new card[cards.size() - numcards];            for (int i = 0; i &lt; cards.size()-numcards; i++)           {            small[i] = this.cards.get(i);            }           this.cards.toarray(small);           return dealt;      } </code></pre>
c#|wpf|mvvm|binding|double,how to reduce count of binding exceptions when binding height and width in wpf   i want to bind items width and height to a model.    for some items width and height is specified but most of them should be set to  auto  mode.    so i created model with property:   <pre><code>    public double  height     {         get         {             return this.height;         }          set         {             this.height = value;             this.onpropertychanged( height );         }     } </code></pre>   and i bind it to my view.     in case if <strong>height == null</strong> my control size is set to auto and this is ok. but i have exceptions:   <pre><code>    system.windows.data error: 5 : value produced by bindingexpression is not valid for target property.; value= &lt;null&gt;  bindingexpression:path=height; target property is  height  (type  double ) </code></pre>   how can i force my control to set height to  auto  and avoid exceptions generation

java|deployment|ram,.jar uses more ram on one pc than another  so i have a little issue. i have my desktop computer and my laptop. i am developping an audioplayer and i was doing  some tests on performance  and i noticed that on the desktop the program runs with 59mb of ram on  taskmanager  while on my laptop it runs at only 48mb of ram. i have no clue where this difference comes from  because the following statements are facts:   <ol> <li>i have exactly the same jre/jdk versions installed on both  machines. </li> <li>both my pc and laptop are 64-bit up-to-date windows 8.1 machines</li> <li>both .jar files are the same (i even replaced one on my desktop with the one from my laptop)</li> <li>in netbeans itself (yet again  both machines have same version and settings) on my desktop it runs at 50mb  and on my laptop at 35mb of ram</li> </ol>   same thing happens when i wrap the program in a .exe file with launch4j and use a bundled java path (the one from my laptop). again my pc runs with way more ram than my laptop.    does anyone perhaps have an idea where this huge difference in performance comes from  i m at a loss  and i m trying to get the ram of my desktop to lower as well.    <strong>important note</strong> i figgured out that this also happens when making a very basic program with a jframe. on my laptop the empty frame uses only 18mb of ram  on my pc it uses 28mb of ram. i think that this is where the difference is coming from. but what are potential causes of this massive difference in performance     <strong>specifications laptop</strong> 8gb ram intel i5-5200u @2.2ghz intel hd graphics 5500    <strong>specifications pc</strong> 8gb ram intel i5-3470 @3.2ghz nvidia gtx960
java|multithreading,swingworker in java (beginner question)  i am relatively new to multi-threading and want to execute a background task using a swingworker thread - the method that is called does not actually return anything but i would like to be notified when it has completed.    from all the tutorials that i have seen online about using swingworkers are created such as   <pre><code>new swingworker&lt;string  void&gt;;  </code></pre>   would declaring mine as void  void be suitable as there is no data being returned     the code i have so far doesn t appear to be working:    <pre><code>private void crawl(actionevent evt) {     try     {     swingworker&lt;void  void&gt; crawler = new swingworker&lt;void  void&gt;()     {         @override         protected void doinbackground() throws exception         {             discoverer discover = new discoverer();             discover.crawl();             return null;         }          @override         protected void done()         {             joptionpane.showmessagedialog(jfthis   finished crawling    success   joptionpane.information_message);         }      };     crawler.execute();     }     catch (exception ex)     {          joptionpane.showmessagedialog(this  ex.getmessage()   exception   joptionpane.error_message);     } } </code></pre>   any feedback/advice would be greatly appreciated as multi-threading is a big area of programming that i am weak in.
java|database|postgresql|hibernate,hibernate multiple connections dynamically changing  i know there are similar questions about this scenario  however none of them i have found matches my case and i ll like to have a solution that doesn t impact performance. i have to do multiple connections to different databases (all postgresql) and the problem is that the databases can be many as they are continuously being created.     at the moment i will only have one known database which will be used to store the connection strings from the other databases. these databases can be 1  2  5  10 or n  the tricky part is that from my end i ll never know how many they will be and what their location and credentials will be (all stored on my central db). the use case works in a way where in order to do an operation on one of these databases  i have to first fetch from the central database the location for the db we need and then perform the operation.     at the moment  i have been able to perform the operation by sing sessionfactory  but the operation is too slow even for a simple select/update  and my concern is that when multiple requests are made  we might get from hibernate an out of memory exception.    any ideas on what would be the best approach for this case

java|iterator|nested|nosuchelementexception,removing element from innermost nested iterator in java causes nosuchelementexception  i keep crashing and getting  java.util.nosuchelementexception at the if statement. i was under the impression that while(iterator.hasnext()) ensured that a iterator.next() call wouldn t cause a buffer overrun.     what is the correct algorithm to loop through two nested iterators  and remove elements from one of the iterators when a match is found  without throwing such an exception (which i <em>think</em> is caused by overrunning the array bounds)     enter code here  {   <pre><code>    iterator&lt;integer&gt; d = entitiesdeletequeue.iterator();     iterator&lt;entity&gt; e = entities.iterator();       while (d.hasnext()) {          while (e.hasnext()) {              if (d.next() == e.next().getentityid())                  e.remove();         }        } } </code></pre>
javascript|jquery|json|sesame,load .srj files with jquery s ajax or getjson  can anybody show me an example of how to load the .srj files that result from querying a <strong>sesame sparql</strong> endpoint using <strong>jquery s getjson</strong>  i ve tried setting the accept header and other tricks but i still see the 200 code and apparently no error  but the content of the file is not loaded.   <pre><code>$.getjson( http://localhost:8090/openrdf-sesame/repositories/myrepo queryln=sparql&amp;query=query&amp;limit=none&amp;infer=true&amp;accept=application%2fsparql-results%2bjson   { }  function(data) {    alert( data =    data); }); </code></pre>   i ve tried something like this and countless other variants and it still doesn t work. i have to mention that i tested both cases:   <ol> <li>tomcat is not mounted in apache  case in which we have a cross-domain request - and i tried setting everything that was needed in the browser;</li> <li>tomcat mounted in apache - which as far as i know did not required anything else to work  but still no success.</li> </ol>   here is the <strong>request header</strong>:   <pre><code>accept:application/json  text/javascript  */*; q=0.01 accept-encoding:gzip  deflate accept-language:en-us en;q=0.5 connection:keep-alivehost:localhost:8090 origin:http://localhost referer:http://localhost/d3v280/examples/ablodvis/localtest.html user-agent:mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 6.1; wow64; rv:12.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/12.0 </code></pre>   here is the <strong>response header</strong>:   <pre><code>content-disposition:attachment; filename=query-result.srj content-language:en-us content-type:application/sparql-results+json;charset=utf-8 date:mon  28 may 2012 14:06:06 gmt server:apache-coyote/1.1 transfer-encoding:chunked </code></pre>   as you can see i do get a result in the query-result.srj file  but i don t know how to access it. i would very much prefer the first version to work  but apparently i am missing something. all the similar getjson requests worked.     here is the request that almost works:   <pre><code> $.ajax({          beforesend: function(xhrobj){                       xhrobj.setrequestheader( accept   application/sparql-results+json );                 }           datatype:  jsonp           url: queryurl          success: function(data) {           // callback code here           console.log( source:   + data.length)           alert( success! );         }       }); </code></pre>   however it throws an  invalid label error  in firefox  while in chrome it doesn t throw any error  but as i see on the <em>second line</em> of my <em>query-results.srj</em> file it shows <em>uncaught syntaxerror: unexpected token :</em>. here is how the first lines of the response look like:   <pre><code>{  head : {      vars : [  s    p    o    r  ] }    results : {      bindings : [ ... </code></pre>   this time i am able to see the request done successfully and see it in my browser (at least in debug mode in both chrome and firefox). should i understand that the jsonp trick doesn t work with sesame  if i take the answer from sesame  copy it in a file  rename it <em>file.js</em> and load it with $.getjson it works ok...i don t want to have any server-side code for this application  just to process the result of a sparql query directly. i ve easily setup up the rest of the sources (worldbank  dbpedia  and others) through $.getjson or $.ajax.    best regards!

python|python-2.7|scikit-learn|python-module,how can i import a different version of a python module   i need to run my python script under sklearn v0.17 and on the server they have sklearn v0.15 installed.    so i downloaded the <code>scikit-learn-0.17</code> package into <code>/home/mydir/lib/python2.7/site-packages/</code> and installed the package.    however when i goto other directories and tried to run python and <code>import sklearn</code> the version is still 0.15.    i created <code>~/.startup.py</code> and put the following code   <pre><code>import sys   sys.path.insert(0  /home/mydir/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ ) </code></pre>   then i pointed to <code>~/.startup.py</code> in <code>~/.bashrc</code> with    <pre><code>pythonstartup=~/.startup.py </code></pre>   but it does not help.    i am wondering how to fix this. thank you!    the following files/dirs are in <code>site-packages/</code>   <pre><code>easy-install.pth              scikit-learn-0.17         site.pyc pysam-0.9.1.4                 scikit_learn-0.17-py2.7.egg-info  site.pyo pysam-0.9.1.4-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg  site.py               sklearn </code></pre>

java|generics|iterator|types,safely traversing a raw iterator in java   i m using a third party library that returns a raw iterator  e.g.   <pre><code>iterator&lt; &gt; children = element.getchildelements(); </code></pre>   i know the actual type  but i don t necessarily trust the third party lib to stick with it in the future.  there are two (that i can think of) somewhat <strong>risky</strong> ways to traverse this:   <pre><code>@suppresswarnings( unchecked ) iterator&lt;actualobject&gt; currentchildren = (iterator&lt;actualobject&gt;)currentelement.getchildelements(); </code></pre>   or   <pre><code>iterator&lt; &gt; children = element.getchildelements(); while (null != children &amp;&amp; children.hasnext()) {   actualobject child = (actualobject)children.next(); //possible classcastexception @ runtime   ... } </code></pre>   the only  safe  way i could come up with to traverse this sort of iterator is the following:   <pre><code>iterator&lt; &gt; children = element.getchildelements(); while (null != children &amp;&amp; children.hasnext()) {   object obj = children.next();   actualobject child = null;     if (obj instanceof actualobject)       child = (actualobject)obj;     ... } </code></pre>   <strong>this seems overly verbose. is there a better  yet equally  safe  way to traverse a raw iterator </strong>    edit: i realize i can catch/log the exception in an else block  i was looking (hoping) for a java language equivalent of what colind has mentioned below.
c#|matrix|xna|rectangles,when i used matrix and rectangle assignment in xna does it duplicate or reference   i have a question about xna which i am new too and could not find a clear answer for in the documentation after searching google.    question 1:    if i do this:   <pre><code>rectangle aftermoverect = collisionrectangle; aftermoverect.offset((int)moveamount.x  (int)moveamount.y); </code></pre>   did i now:    a. refference collisionrectangle with another name and afterwards moved collisionrectangle    or    b. created a duplicate copy of collisionrectangle and only moved the copy.    second question:    if i do this:   <pre><code>matrix transform = localtransform;  transform = transform * othertransform; </code></pre>   did i create a copy of localtransform and mulitplied the copy or did i reference localtransform and multiplied it through another identifier     the question for both is the same  did i change the original (perhaps unintentionally)    question 3:    how do you know if you changed the original or not  how do you know if you reference the original with a new name (like in java) or create a deep copy of the other object when using the assignment operator

javascript|jquery|html|debugging,variables created in jquery not appearing in debugger  i have written some code in jquery that when a button is pressed  creates a new variable and displays it on the screen.  i d like to take whatever data is entered into this new variable and store it in a database however before i get there i have to figure out to access the variables information properly.    in html i have 3 text boxes created and a button to add up to 7 more for a total of 10.  my code looks like this (and these store in the database just fine):   <pre><code>&lt;table style= width:90%  class= long-term-conditions &gt; &lt;center&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;long term condition 1:&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;input type= text  id= var1  name = var1  value= %var1%  /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;long term condition 2:&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;input type= text  id= var2  name = var2  value= %var2%  /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;long term condition 3:&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;input type= text  id= var3  name = var3  value= %var3%  /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/center&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;a href= #  title=   class= add-cond  id= add-cond &gt;add another long-term health condition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div id= message &gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   my problem now is that my jquery variables cant be inspected (says not available) and no data is passed to the database after.  my jquery looks like this:   <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;    //adds another row to the above table.  var counter = 3;  jquery( a.add-cond ).click(function(event){     event.preventdefault();     if (counter &lt; 10) {   counter++;   var newrow = jquery( &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt; +  long term condition  +  counter +  :  +  &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;input type= text  name= var  +     counter +    id= var  + counter +  value= %var  + counter +  % /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; );   jquery( table.long-term-conditions ).append(newrow);  }   else      {   document.getelementbyid( add-cond ).style.visibility =  hidden ;   document.getelementbyid( message ).innerhtml =  &lt;font color= red &gt;please  contact us&lt;/font&gt; ;  } });  &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   the code works in creating the new variable however any data entered into the newly created text box is never passed to the debugger or the database.  what am i doing wrong   any help is appreciated.
c#|msmq|nservicebus,how can i handle more than one nservicebus project in process   i have a wpf solution that also needs to support receiving of messages from queue1 and sending messages to queue2.  i set this all up and it worked find in early testing.      but when i combined the input and output projects (so i have both projects assemblies in the output folder) i get the following error:   <blockquote>    host doesn t support hosting of multiple endpoints. endpoint classes found: mysolution.queue1.endpointconfig  myproject.queue1  version=1.0.0.0  culture=neutral  publickeytoken=null           mysolution.queue2.endpointconfig  myproject.queue2  version=1.0.0.0  culture=neutral  publickeytoken=null you may have some old assemblies in your runtime directory.          try right-clicking your vs project  and selecting  clean .  </blockquote>   am i going about this wrong   can my wpf process only deal with one queue   (doesn t seem too robust if that is the case.)    maybe i am going about this the wrong way.  should i just send and receive from the same queue   (does that even work right   can a queue deal with more than one message type )
